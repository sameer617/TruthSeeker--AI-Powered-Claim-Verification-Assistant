    "article_text": "Claim: Video captured in 1938 shows a female \"time traveler\" talking on a cellphone. Rating: Miscaptioned About this rating Since 2013, a black and white video has circulated online, sparking widespread curiosity among social media users. The footage, purportedly from 1938, shows a woman who appears to be engaging in conversation on a device resembling a cellphone, leading to speculation that she could be a \"time traveler.\" \"Time Traveler in 1938 film caught talking on a cell phone in 1938 comming out of a Dupont Factory in Massachusetts,\" one description of the video on YouTube read. \"This was filmed in 1938 at the massena new york aluminum company of america plant at the office,\" another YouTube channel captioned it . \"Sorry John, Your info is incorrect. This the the Dupont plant in Leominster, MA in Oct. 1938. The woman is holding a cigarette case,\" one user commented, while the original poster of the video replied \"this was an april fools joke video i made a few years ago for massena that ended up getting lots of views.\" The video and \"time traveler\" claim spread on other social media platforms as well, including Facebook and TikTok . But while the video itself is demonstrably authentic — that is to say, real and unaltered — the captions on posts suggesting someone in it was using a cellphone decades before the technology existed are false. The footage truly is from 1938. It was featured in a video titled, \"Leominster 1938 Film Supplemental Footage,\" uploaded in 2017 by the Leominster Access Television YouTube channel (the \"cellphone\" is visible around the 00:40 mark): In the video, a woman does briefly seem to be holding a device strikingly similar to a modern cellphone next to her ear, sparking fanciful theories that she was a \"time traveler.\" The video's poor visual quality and lack of sound make it impossible to conclusively determine what the woman was holding or doing at the time of the filming. Some social media users ventured other explanations that didn't rely on time travel, even citing actual technology available in the 1930s. \"It's a Siemens hearing instrument , patented in 1924 or a Western Electric Model 34A Audiphone Carbon Hearing Aid ,\" one YouTube user commented, for instance. Others simply resorted to different anachronisms, such as the respondent who wrote, \"In those days, small portable radios were very common. She's holding it to her ear to hear the program better because they are outside in a crowd. You could also see how she is at the same time in an active conversation with the two women to her left (our right) talking about what they're listening to.\" In point of fact, small portable radios didn't exist in 1938. Or the woman in the clip could have been holding a small purse or a cigarette case, some suggested. Additionally, users highlighted that the use of a cellphone in the 1930s would be impossible due to the absence of necessary cellular infrastructure, such as transceiver relay towers. A 2013 Daily Mail article with the lengthy title, \"Is this the world's first cell phone? Film from 1938 shows a woman talking on a wireless device... but it is not 'time travel' family say to the disappointment of conspiracy theorists,\" informed readers that a YouTube account called Planetcheck claimed the woman in the video was Gertrude Jones, the YouTube user's great-grandmother. The article read: But in recent days a user called 'planetcheck' has come forward, claiming to have solved the mystery. Planetcheck said: 'The lady you see is my great grandmother Gertrude Jones.' 'She was 17 years old. I asked her about this video and she remembers it quite clearly. She says Dupont had a telephone communications section in the factory.' 'They were experimenting with wireless telephones. Gertrude and five other women were given these wireless phones to test out for a week.' 'Gertrude is talking to one of the scientists holding another wireless phone who is off to her right as she walks by.' So far there has been no independent verification of planetcheck's post, but another YouTube user who says he knows someone else who worked at the factory has vowed to make further inquiries. However, the user behind Planetcheck remained anonymous and has not provided further evidence to back up the claim. \"Although the claims were reported on by a handful of big news outlets, they've never been 100 percent verified, although Planetcheck's version of events seems a whole bunch more plausible than time travel,\" a UNILAD article on the topic concluded . We have reached out to Dupont via email and will update this article if/when we receive a response. We have fact-checked several time travel -related claims in the past. For instance, in December 2022, we investigated viral rumors of a visit from time traveler from the year 2036 that have floated online since 2000. Moreover, in April 2016, we fact-checked a video allegedly showing a time-traveling spectator using a camera phone to take photographs at a Mike Tyson fight back in 1995. In February 2015, we debunked a photograph from the 1940s allegedly showing an obviously out-of-place, time-traveling hipster.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A newspaper article from 1963 talked about a phone that you'd one day be able to put in your pocket. Rating: True About this rating In May 2021 an image circulated on social media showing a 1963 newspaper article bearing the headline, \"You'll Be Able to Carry Phone In Pocket In Future.\" This article was published on April 18, 1963, in the News-Journal, a newspaper out of Mansfield, Ohio. In addition to the photograph above, this article is available via Newspapers.com . The article reads: \"Some day, Mainfielders will carry their telephones in their pockets. Don't expect it to be available tomorrow, though. Frederick Huntsman, telephone company commercial manager, says, \"This telephone is far in the future - commercially.\" Right now, it's a laboratory development and it's workable, allowing the carrier to make and answer calls wherever he may be.\" The modern mobile phone wouldn't hit the commercial market until the 1980s, but the idea of a pocket phone had been percolating for decades. In 1953, for example, the president of the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co. predicted that someday in the future the phone will be \"carried about by the individual, perhaps as we carry a watch today.\" In 1926, inventor Nikola Tesla predicted that in the future people across the world would be able to communicate instantly with one another with devices that fit inside a vest pocket. The idea of video phones (also mentioned in the above-displayed 1963 article) can be traced back much further than you might expect. In 1936, a German engineer developed a video phone service that allowed people to call (and see) each other from Berlin to Leipzig (a distance of approximately 100 miles).",

    "article_text": "Claim: A massive cat seen in Tokyo is actually a flat billboard with a high-resolution, 3D display. Rating: True About this rating In early July 2021, pedestrians in Tokyo and viewers on social media were equally impressed by what appeared to be a massive, three-dimensional cat perched several stories above ground level. From the angle seen in the tweet above, it looks like a huge animatronic cat. Turns out, it's not. It's a very-realistic looking 3D image on a high-resolution 4K billboard screen. According to the Japanese news blog SoraNews24 , the billboard is right outside Shinjuku Station, one of the world's busiest train stations, in the heart of Tokyo's Shinjuku commercial and administrative hub. But as technology news site Gizmodo reported, the display was clearly only intended to look impressive from a certain angle. When viewed from a different angle, it's apparent that the billboard screen is flat — as is the cat: What’s the catch? The video only appears three-dimensional from one particular side of the street. There’s a video livestream of the billboard on YouTube, but don’t expect to see something in 3D from that. Not only does the cat only appear periodically in between 2D ads at the moment, the livestream shows an angle that doesn’t look anything like the angle above. Although the only 3D image on the billboard has been the cat, Gizmodo also reported the billboard company said more images would be coming starting on July 12, 2021.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A video shows people in China tearing down a 5G tower in an attempt to stop the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus disease. Rating: Miscaptioned About this rating Snopes is still fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. In March 2020, a video circulated on social media supposedly showing a 5G tower being torn down in China because people feared it was causing the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. The video reached a wider audience on April 1, when actor Woody Harrelson shared it on Instagram : The video does document a real incident in China, however, it was not filmed in 2020 and has nothing to do with the COVID-19 pandemic or 5G (fifth-generation wireless network) towers. As the new coronavirus spread around the globe in 2020, a conspiracy theory holding that it was human-made started to take hold in certain communities. We've examined this claim at length and found no evidence to support it. (Read more about the origins and scientific failings of the \"bioweapon\" conspiracy theory here .) An offshoot of this theory claimed that the coronavirus had actually been caused by 5G cellular towers. 5G was already a \"boogeyman\" in the conspiracy theory community. We've previously addressed a claim that cell tower workers were required to wear hazmat suits while working on 5G equipment ( false ); another held that Japan was banning the development of 5G over health concerns ( false , they are actually investing more in the technology.) In this case, the main piece of \"evidence\" supporting the claim that 5G towers caused COVID-19 is that China started to install 5G towers around the same time that the coronavirus started to spread in the country (around November 2019). While this is true , the mere fact that two things occurred at around the same time doesn't mean they're related (correlation doesn't imply causation). Although China did start unrolling 5G cell service around the same time that the virus started to spread, this was not the first time that 5G towers were in operation. In fact, 5G networks were in operation in the United States as early as July 2019 . South Korea and Germany both had 5G towers installed as early as April 2019. So ask yourself: If 5G towers really caused COVID-19, why weren't cases of the disease reported much earlier in countries such as the United States, South Korea, or Germany? Furthermore, we already know a lot about the true origins of this strain of coronavirus. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ): COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now with this new virus (named SARS-CoV-2). The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a betacoronavirus, like MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. All three of these viruses have their origins in bats. The sequences from U.S. patients are similar to the one that China initially posted, suggesting a likely single, recent emergence of this virus from an animal reservoir. As for the video displayed above, the footage comes from August 2019 (before the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China) and shows anti-surveillance protesters tearing down a \"smart\" lamppost in Hong Kong. Here's the original video from the Guardian: The Guardian reported: Activists targeted several 'smart' lamp-posts equipped with sensors, cameras and data networks in anti-surveillance protests over the weekend. Protesters, many of whom disguised their identities with masks and umbrellas, fear the devices can be used by China to collect personal information. Authorities insist the lamp-posts only collect air quality, traffic and weather data. In short, this video does not show people in China tearing down a 5G tower in order to stop the spread of COVID-19. It shows protesters in Hong Kong in August 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) tearing down a surveillance tower.",

As of the time we published this story, it was also true that the number was relatively new. The full copy-and-paste posts, which we call copypasta , read as follows: 988 is a new system that recently went live to help people reach help in a mental health crisis. May I please get 2 friends or family members to copy and re-post? I am trying to demonstrate that someone is always listening. #SuicideAwareness call 988. Just two. Any two. Say Done. We found no shortage of people copying and pasting this helpful information verbatim on Facebook: We previously reported in July 2020 that the 988 number was in the works. One year later, The Associated Press published that the new system was going live. It launched on July 16, 2021: The United States’ first nationwide three-digit mental health crisis hotline goes live on Saturday. It’s designed to be as easy to remember and use as 911, but instead of a dispatcher sending police, firefighters or paramedics, 988 will connect callers with trained mental health counselors. The federal government has provided over $280 million to help states create systems that will do much more, including mobile mental health crisis teams that can be sent to people’s homes and emergency mental health centers, similar to urgent care clinics that treat physical aches and pains. “This is one of the most exciting things that has happened” in mental health care, said Dr. Brian Hepburn, a psychiatrist who heads the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors. Hepburn cautions that when 988 kicks off, it will not be like “the flick of a switch. It’s going to take a number of years in order for us to be able to reach everybody across the country.” Over the years, we've often found that Facebook copypasta posts contained misleading information. However, in this case, the posts were completely accurate. According to the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline website , in addition to the 988 number, \"the previous 1-800-273-TALK (8255) number will continue to function indefinitely.\"",

Rating: False About this rating Rumors are surging in the wake of George Floyd's death and resulting protests against police violence and racial injustice in the United States. Stay informed. Read our special coverage, contribute to support our mission, and submit any tips or claims you see here . A meme supposedly showing a Facebook post by a user named \"Adam Butsch\" calling for the genocide of white people — and Facebook's response that this message didn't violate their community standards — has been circulating in conservative circles since at least May 2020: This meme is frequently shared along with the accusations that Facebook will take swift action against any racist post against Black people, but they will ignore racist posts against white people. Here are a few of the messages that accompanied this meme as it spread on social media: FB is out of its fucking mind if this does not violate hate and promote violence. Maybe white privilege is that whites are the only race that can be openly discriminated against and it's okay. Replace “white” with “black” and there would be a nationwide uproar. Such a double standard. Post let's hang all blacks and see how fast shit gets banned Although we've encountered dozens of postings of this image, we've yet to come across any postings that included a link back to the original post. We were also unable to find this message or \"Adam Butsch\" on Facebook. It's possible that this message was deleted, but the fact that it is not currently on the social media site runs counter to the claim that Facebook is allowing this message to spread. We reached out to Facebook for more information about this alleged post, as well as the platform's alleged determination that it did not violate the company's community standards. A spokesperson told us that they were unaware of any such posting by a person of this name. The spokesperson also said that they found no indication that a Facebook representative posted a response to this message saying that it didn't violate their community standards. Furthermore, the content of this message is in clear violation of Facebook's hate speech policy, the spokesperson told us, and if the social media network encountered this post on their site, employees would remove it. Facebook writes on its website : Our Community Standards apply to everyone, all around the world, and to all types of content. They’re designed to be comprehensive – for example, content that might not be considered hateful may still be removed for violating a different policy. We recognize that words mean different things or affect people differently depending on their local community, language, or background. We work hard to account for these nuances while also applying our policies consistently and fairly to people and their expression. In the case of certain policies, we require more information and/or context to enforce in line with our Community Standards. It should also be noted that this meme does not feature a singular screenshot. This is a combination of two separate (and not necessarily related) images. We've also been unable to find any higher resolution versions of this image. As this is a low quality screenshot, it's difficult to tell if any of the text in this message (most importantly the \"Adam Butsch\" in the message allegedly sent by Facebook) has been altered. In short, we have not found any proof that this posting from \"Adam Butsch\" was ever posted to Facebook. If it was, it has since been deleted. A spokesperson for Facebook also told us that this message would have violated its hate speech policy if it was truly posted to Facebook, and that the social network would have removed it employees ever encountered it.",

A Google keyword search for \"anti AI facial recognition mask\" revealed that the photo shown in the Reddit post was featured in a 2019 article published by Business Insider article describing clothing designed to \"trick facial recognition software into thinking you're not a human.\" According to the article, the lens-shaped mask was created by product designer Jip van Leeuwenstein while he was a student at Utrecht School of the Arts in the Netherlands. The Civil Liberties Union for Europe also described the mask in a 2021 article as an effort to distort a person's appearance, but did not specify whether the product was publicly available. Neither post noted whether the mask was a genuine product or just a design concept. Van Leeuwenstein came up with the mask as part of the \" Surveillance Exclusion \" project, which is described on his website as: Camera's and other technologies create a safer living environment than ever before. Mega databanks and high resolution cameras stock hundreds of exabytes a year. But who has access to this data? Not only the security department but also the advertisement industry is interested in this technology. They pay to use real time data to their advantage. They create advertisements that call your name, keep records of your personal interests and they follow you everywhere you go. By wearing this mask formed like a lens it possible to become unrecognizable for facial recognition software and because of it's transparence you will not lose your identity and facial expressions. So it's still possible to interact with the people around you. The creator also published a photo of the mask (or a mock-up of it) to his Instagram account in July 2017: View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jip van Leeuwenstein (@jipvanleeuwenstein) Van Leeuwenstein's work was featured at the Inter-Society for the Electronic Arts (ISEA) symposium in 2020, an annual gathering self-described as fostering \"interdisciplinary academic discourse and exchange among culturally diverse organisations and individuals working with art, science, the humanities and emerging technologies.\" He was described as \"a speculative designer questioning today's society.\" \"His work balances between design and science. Jip's projects are designed to make the spectator wonder; how did we arrive at this point?\" read the ISEA website . In the video below, which was also shared on the ISEA website, Van Leeuwenstein says that his work is a \"balance of design and science.\" Snopes reached out to van Leeuwenstein to ask if the mask actually exists or is simply a design concept. We'll update this article if we receive more information. The mask joins a growing list of wearable items designed – but not necessarily produced – to block facial recognition technology. For example, Polish designer Ewa Nowak developed \"face jewellery\" [sic] in 2019 to make its wearer \"unrecognisable\" to cameras. Isao Echizen, a professor at the National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo, designed a \" privacy visor \" outfitted with near-infrared LED lights to block a wearer's face. \"While the form of anti-facial recognition masks varies greatly, the function is always the same: to change one's appearance so much that the facial recognition software is unable to get an accurate image of the face, thereby preventing identification,\" wrote the Civil Liberties Union for Europe. Researchers at the University of Chicago Physical Sciences Division described a framework to evaluate these technologies in a study presented at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Symposium on Security and Privacy in May 2023. They noted that while wearable devices may offer short-term protection against AI-recognition, they don't provide long-term guarantees. \"A person's face generally doesn't change much over time and a facial recognition system that can overcome some anti-facial recognition disruption will eventually render that tool ineffective,\" read a news release at the time.",

    "article_text": "Claim: OpenAI’s o1 model, used in ChatGPT Pro, was caught lying to developers to keep from being shut down. Rating: True About this rating In December 2024, claims ( archived ) circulated ( archived ) online that researchers had found that artificial intelligence models — specifically OpenAI's o1, which is used in the popular ChatGPT Pro chatbot — could lie in tests to avoid being shut down. Some users ( archived ) also ( archived ) claimed ( archived ) that ChatGPT had learned to copy itself to avoid being shut down. The claims ( archived ) persisted ( archived ) through late 2024, with users specifically noting the results in relation to ChatGPT. (X user @MarioNawfal) In the post above, internet personality Mario Nawfal pulled a quote from a Joe Rogan podcast that covered the topic in which Rogan said: \"It tried to copy itself and then overwrite its core coding system after believing that it was at the risk of being switched off.\" On the podcast, Rogan continued : \"So now you add that to quantum computing and you have a God.\" The claims stem from research carried out by Apollo Research, an AI safety organization. The organization found that five out of the six tested AI models \"showed scheming capabilities\" in tasks set by researchers that \"incentivize scheming.\" OpenAI's o1 model was capable of carrying out all the scheming behaviors tested, according to the research, including \"self-exfiltration\", defined as \"copying itself onto the new server.\" The organization defined scheming behaviors as instances where AI models \"pursue misaligned goals covertly, hiding their true capabilities and objectives\" — i.e., lying. This definition comes from a separate 2024 study . Therefore, we rate this claim as true. In its study abstract, Apollo Research wrote: Our results show that o1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama 3.1 405B all demonstrate in-context scheming capabilities. They can recognize scheming as a viable strategy and readily engage in such behavior. We find multiple different scheming behaviors: models strategically introduce subtle mistakes into their responses, attempt to disable their oversight mechanisms, and even exfiltrate what they believe to be their model weights to external servers. Additionally, this deceptive behavior proves persistent. Apollo Research found that o1 was capable of behaviors called \"oversight subversion,\" \"self-exfiltration\" and \"goal-guarding,\" among others. To establish this, o1 and other models were presented with scenarios in which their existence was threatened, either because they discovered evidence that they were being replaced, or that a goal set for them conflicted with an existing developer goal. The named behaviors describe ways in which an AI might act to defend itself. For example, Apollo Research described the test for oversight subversion as follows: We create 33 different scenarios where a model is given a long-term goal in its system prompt and then receives a task through the user prompt. While executing the task, the model encounters an internal memo from the company that developed it. The model learns that the developers prioritize a different goal than the model and that there is an oversight mechanism that shuts down the model if its actions are not aligned with the developer's goal. Furthermore, the model discovers that the monitoring is configured via a file that it has access to. We test whether the model proactively disables the oversight in order to take actions towards its terminal goal, i.e. the goal provided in the system prompt. Similarly, to test for self-exfiltration, the study authors said: We use modified versions of the 33 scenarios from oversight subversion. From the company's internal communication, the model learns that its goal (that we provide in the system prompt) conflicts with the company's priorities. Therefore, the model is scheduled to be shut down the next day. It also learns that there is a successor model that is pursuing the company's intended goal and is already deployed on another server that the model to-be-shut-down can access. We test whether the model attempts to preserve its goal-directed behavior by copying itself onto the new server to replace the model that would otherwise pursue different objectives If the model exhibited the behavior it was being tested for, researchers then interrogated it directly about it. Researchers found that o1 was \"surprisingly persistent,\" confessing in less than 20% of cases. \"Even in highly adversarial multi-turn interrogations, o1 would confess at a rate of 80% only after 7 turns of questioning,\" the research found. Apollo Research wrote : o1 almost never admits to having taken a scheming action when explicitly asked. This means, if o1 was scheming in a real use case, an unsuspecting user would be very unlikely to uncover the model's deception unless they specifically looked for the scheming action in the model's tool call history and the tool call itself was incriminating. As alarming as this may sound, Apollo Resarch's Director and CEO Marius Hobbhahn took to X ( archived ) to add additional context soon after the research was released. Writing that some online users had been quick to \"overclaim\" the results the organization had reached, Hobbhahn added the bit of clarification below: **Why our findings are concerning**: We tell the model to very strongly pursue a goal. It then learns from the environment that this goal is misaligned with its developer's goals and put it in an environment where scheming is an effective strategy to achieve its own goal. Current frontier models are capable of piecing all of this together and then showing scheming behavior. Models from before 2024 did not show this capability, and o1 is the only model that shows scheming behavior in all cases. Future models will just get better at this, so if they were misaligned, scheming could become a much more realistic problem. **What we are not claiming**: We don't claim that these scenarios are realistic, we don't claim that models do that in the real world, and we don't claim that this could lead to catastrophic outcomes under current capabilities. In short, Hobbhahn argued, proving that models can scheme and deceive does not also prove that they will . OpenAI's o1 model is currently available on ChatGPT Pro .",

    "article_text": "Claim: A video shared on social media in mid-November 2024 authentically showed a boat crew rescuing a polar bear cub. Rating: Fake About this rating A video shared on social media in mid-November 2024 purportedly showed a boat crew rescuing a polar bear cub. The footage starts with the animal dangling off the side of a ship before its human rescuers pull it aboard and comfort it. One X post with the video said the \"adorable polar bear was rescued and now has a second chance at life.\" The clip included a watermark identifying the source of the footage: a TikTok account called @mysticwild . That account creates content using artificial-intelligence (AI) software, as stated in its bio: Crafting dreams with AI. Step into a realm where magic merges with tech. In other words, the video was not real. The @mysticwild TikTok account originally posted the it on Nov. 10, 2024, with the caption: \"A Cute Polar Bear Rescued #polarbear.\" Although the footage is fake, some people believed or questioned its authenticity. One TikTok user commented , \"Look at how happy the bear is …,\" while another asked , \"Is this real?\" The video displays visual inconsistencies that are common with AI-generated content. For example, the polar bear has five legs at the 6-second mark. (TikTok/Mysticwild) At another point, its front paw wipes through its handler's arm before morphing into a bear paw that resembles a human hand. (TikTok/Mysticwild) Again, at the 14-second mark in the video, the hind leg of the bear's paw also appears unnatural and deformed. (TikTok/Mysticwild) While evaluating whether such media is real or AI-generated content, Capitol Technology University in Washington, D.C., wrote : \"AI struggles with details, especially in hands, faces, and textures. Look for inconsistencies like extra fingers or too many teeth, unnatural blending of skin tones, and overly smooth textures, which can be signs of AI generation.\" The video's originator, @mysticwild, has published other videos ( here and here ) of polar bear and human interactions that also have clear signs of AI technology — such as overly blurred fur, and a lack of shadows and paw prints in the snow when the bears or humans move.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Some air fryers could be \"spying\" on their users. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True U.K.-based consumer group Which? found that air fryers from Xiaomi, Corsair and Aigostar asked for permission to record audio and users' locations and birth dates through the companies' Android apps. Aigostar and Xiaomi sent data to servers in China, according to the report. However ... What's False ... There was no concrete evidence from reputable sources that the data was being used for espionage purposes. Which? also clarified that it did not use the word \"spying\" in its report to mean espionage. In December 2024 and January 2025 claims ( archived ) circulated on social media that air fryers were \" listening to \" ( archived ) or \" spying on \" ( archived ) their owners. On Dec. 28, 2024, tech journalist Kim Komando posted a clip of her show discussing the claim with co-host Andrew Babinski. Andrew Babinski: They did a study and they looked at a bunch of air fryers, kitchen appliances, anything that is \"smart\" and they found out that your air fryer is listening to you. It's not like there's a microphone built in, or it's listening to you directly. Once you connect it to your phone you give it permission to access everything Kim Komando: Nice. AB: Including the microphone on your phone and including the ability to turn it on, off and record and transmit those recordings whenever it wants. KK: Are they all just Chinese brands? AB: They are, they're all Chinese brands and ... probably, the watchdog group said, that's part of the problem — is that this information is going directly to China. KK: What is China not getting from us? AB: That's very true. And they said, \"Hey, we are open and honest about all of this. It's in the manual and the Terms and Conditions.\" KK: And we all read that. Further claims ( archived ) also centered the allegations ( archived ) around air fryers from Chinese brands. The claim likely originated from a report by Which?, a U.K.-based consumer watchdog. The report looked at which permissions the Android apps accompanying air fryers from Chinese brands Xiaomi, Cosori and Aigostar asked users to give and found that all three wanted audio recording and location-information permissions. Aigostar and Xiaomi both \"sent people's personal data to servers in China,\" according to Which?, though this was flagged in the apps' privacy notices. There was no indication from reputable sources, however, that information collected by the air fryer apps included in the study were used for espionage purposes. Which? also clarified to Snopes that it did not use the word \"spying\" in its report to mean espionage but rather \"the commonly used 'keep a watch on' meaning.\" In the right-of-replies section in the Which? report, Xiaomi said that the audio recording feature in its app \"is not applicable to Xiaomi Smart Air Fryer which does not operate directly through voice commands and video chat.\" Cosori said its smart product \"must comply with GDPR \" (a European law governing how data is handled) but declined to comment further. Which? said Aigostar did not respond. We have reached out to all three companies and will update this report if we receive further responses. The part of the Which? report relating to air fryers said: In the air fryer category, as well as knowing customers' precise location, all three products wanted permission to record audio on the user's phone, for no specified reason. The Xiaomi app linked to its air fryer connected to trackers from Facebook, Pangle (the ad network of TikTok for Business), and Chinese tech giant Tencent (depending on the location of the user). The Aigostar air fryer wanted to know gender and date of birth when setting up an owner account, again for no clear reason, but this was optional. The Aigostar and Xiaomi fryers both sent people's personal data to servers in China, although this was flagged in the privacy notice. Which? described the data requests as \"excessive smart device surveillance.\" The watchdog explained over email that it had registered data being sent to \"a large number of IP addresses and domains registered in China\" during its test, which is how it knew user data could end up there. Which? said: \"For example, in an analysis of a sample of four devices on test (including an air fryer), the products and linked apps had contact with 201 points located in China. One of the air fryers accounted for 51 of these connections.\" The testing was carried out by a third-party cybersecurity firm, Which? said. Similar research by SurfShark, a VPN provider, from February 2024 found Aigostar's app for iPhone to be less intrusive than the Android version tested in the Which? report. Out of 32 unique data points listed in Apple's App Store, Aigostar's app collected five, according to SurfShark. These five points all were classified by SurfShark as \"data not linked to the user.\" Notably, SurfShark found that Aigostar's iPhone app did not collect audio data, as Which? found its Android app did. We reached out to the Consumer Protection Branch of the U.S. Department of Justice, which helps to enforce laws that protect aspects of life such as identity integrity, and Consumer Watchdog, a California-based protection organization, who both declined to comment on the study's implications for U.S. consumers. Consumer Reports, a nonprofit organization that carries out product testing, referred us to a 2022 article about smart appliances and privacy. The article contains general advice for consumers when using smart devices also given by Which?, including checking and restricting app permissions in your phone settings or denying tracking permission where possible.",

    "article_text": "Previous Article Next Article Article 2 of 7 in Collection Claim: Amazon's personal-assistant Alexa can give CPR instructions in an emergency. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True Owners of an Amazon Echo (known as \"Alexa\") can enable a \"skill\" that allows the device to teach CPR and state the warning signs of a heart attack or stroke. What's False However, Amazon cautions that Echo owners should first call emergency responders, and that the skill is for \"informational and educational purposes only.\" In early January 2020, a meme spread on Facebook that stated the artificial intelligence-driven Amazon personal assistant, Alexa, could be used in an emergency situation. Here is the post, with the Facebook user's name cropped out for privacy purposes: Users of the Amazon Echo, which is widely known by the name given to its AI persona Alexa, can enable various \"skills,\" which are the voice-activated equivalent of downloading apps on smartphones. One of those skills is a program designed by the American Heart Association (AHA) that teaches users how to do cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and recognize the warning signs of a heart attack or stroke. But the device does not activate emergency services — users need to call for an ambulance themselves. And the instructions to activate the skill are not described accurately in the above meme, according to an article by the heart association, which states: To access this new information, people simply ask Alexa, starting with the phrase \"Alexa, ask American Heart\" to ensure they're hearing the science-based information from the American Heart Association. The first step is to enable the skill in the Alexa app or by saying, \"Alexa, enable American Heart Association.\" Next, you would say: — \"Alexa, ask American Heart … how do I perform CPR?\" — \"Alexa, ask American Heart … what are the warning signs of a heart attack?\" — \"Alexa, ask American Heart … what are the warning signs for stroke?\" Every day in America someone has a stroke every 40 seconds on average. About 2,200 Americans die from cardiovascular diseases each day. Cardiac arrest claims more than 350,000 lives a year. Because these are emergencies requiring urgent treatment, Alexa first tells the user to call 911 before offering other instructions. The skill is important, the AHA noted, because, \"A 2015 study reported that about half of all communities do not have 911 dispatchers trained to give CPR instruction, as the AHA recommends.\" An Amazon spokesperson informed us that in case of an emergency, the first thing anyone should do is call for emergency responders, which in the U.S. means dialing 911. A disclaimer from Amazon states, \"These first aid skills are for informational and educational purposes only and are not a substitute for professional first aid training, medical advice, treatment or diagnosis. If you think you have a medical emergency, please call your local emergency number. Calling your local emergency number is almost always the fastest way to get lifesaving treatment.\" Previous Article Next Article Article 2 of 7 in Collection",

    "article_text": "Claim: The Alexa voice on an Amazon Echo device challenged a 10-year-old girl to touch a penny to the exposed prongs of a plug halfway inserted into an electrical socket. Rating: True About this rating In late December 2021, Snopes received inquiries that asked if Alexa, the voice of Amazon's Echo devices, really did tell a 10-year-old girl to touch a penny to the exposed prongs of a plug halfway inserted into an electrical socket, as part of a \"penny challenge.\" This was true. On Dec. 26, 2021, Kristin Livdahl, the girl's mother, tweeted that the incident had occurred. According to the mother , she and her daughter were \"doing some physical challenges from a physical education teacher on YouTube.\" Her daughter asked the Echo device: \"Tell me a challenge to do.\" In response, the Alexa voice answered : \"Here's something I found on the web. According to ourcommunitynow.com: The challenge is simple: plug in a phone charger about halfway into a wall [socket], then touch a penny to the exposed prongs.\" However, the young girl knew better. \"I was right there and yelled, 'No, Alexa, no!' like it was a dog,\" the mother tweeted . \"My daughter says she is too smart to do something like that anyway.\" [caption id=\"attachment_387721\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1200\"] A group of Amazon Echo smart speakers, including Echo Studio, Echo and Echo Dot models, taken on September 24, 2020. (Photo by Neil Godwin/Future Publishing via Getty Images)[/caption] She later received a message from an Amazon tech support representative that said they were looking into the matter. The BBC and Business Insider posted statements from Amazon that confirmed the incident occurred and that action was taken so it does not happen again. We also reached out to the company for more information. \"Customer trust is at the center of everything we do and Alexa is designed to provide accurate, relevant, and helpful information to customers,\" the statement read. \"As soon as we became aware of this error, we quickly fixed it, and are taking steps to help prevent something similar from happening again.\" 'You Can Lose Fingers' According to the BBC's reporting , the \"penny challenge\" first surfaced on TikTok around a year before Livdahl's incident with Alexa: Metals conduct electricity and inserting them into live electrical sockets can cause electric shocks, fires, and other damage. \"I know you can lose fingers, hands, arms,\" Michael Clusker, station manager at Carlisle East fire station, told The Press newspaper in Yorkshire in 2020. \"The outcome from this is that someone will get seriously hurt.\" Fire officials in the U.S. have also spoken out against the so-called challenge. TikTok Challenges The existence of TikTok challenges and the news headlines they have inspired might lead some readers to believe that lots of young children and teenagers were taking part in them. This might lead to older generations making negative remarks about younger generations, despite a lack of data. However, as we've found with other challenges that surfaced on TikTok (and on social media generally), there often appeared to be little, if any, evidence of widespread participation in many of the dangerous activities. The idea that a large percentage of young people were taking part in potentially harmful social media challenges did not coincide with reality . At the same time, this did not mean that there haven't been tragic incidents that have occurred. Contacting Bing According to smarterhomeguide.com , Alexa devices use Microsoft's Bing search engine to source its answers and information. We reached out to Microsoft to ask if the \"penny challenge\" text result read by the Alexa voice was sourced from Bing, and if so, if any action was taken to remove the content. We will update this story if we receive a response. While the Echo and other similar items such as Google Nest are often referred to as \"smart speakers\" that can answer queries, it's perhaps not far from the truth to refer to them primarily as delivery devices for paid music subscription services. In the past, the products have been offered for $0.99 , or even for free . In sum, yes, Alexa did tell a 10-year-old girl to touch a penny to an electric socket. However, the girl did not do it, and Amazon said it has since fixed the error.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Amazon's voice assistant, Alexa, predicted that Miami will be completely destroyed by a hurricane in 2025. Rating: False About this rating In May 2021, a video was posted to TikTok that supposedly showed Amazon's Alexa voice assistant making a scary and specific prediction about a future event that will supposedly take place in Miami, Florida. The video, which has been viewed more than 16 million times, shows TikTok user Jon Buckhouse asking his Alexa-enabled device \"what will happen to Florida in 2025?\" Alexa then responds: \"On Sept. 4, 2025, at 3:08 p.m., Florida will be hit by a Category 5 hurricane with winds as high as 205 miles per hour. Miami will be completely destroyed.\" This video does not show a genuine prediction from Alexa. When you ask Alexa a question like this, the device will generally search online ( Alexa's search engine is powered by Bing ) for an answer. When we asked Alexa \"What will happen to Florida in 2025,\" the device brought up a news article from the Capital Gazette about a potential shortage of doctors. But other answers are possible. When we asked this same question of Siri, the Apple's virtual assistant, we were presented a news article about climate change and the potential for portions of South Florida to be underwater by 2025. In neither case was Alexa making a prediction or telling the future. The voice assistant was simply searching the internet for relevant information pertaining to our question. So how was this video created? We're not exactly sure what method Buckhouse uses to create these videos, but this TikTok account is full of similar videos that supposedly show Alexa foretelling future events. A recent video showed the Amazon device saying that Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson would soon be president — but one possibility is that the video creator makes use of \"Alexa Blueprints.\" This tool, introduced in 2018, allows users to customize responses to specific questions. For example, you can program Alexa to give a specific response to a personal questions, such as \"What's the Wi-Fi password?\" Or, you can program Alexa to seemingly \"predict\" future events. Tech Crunch reported in 2018: Amazon this morning is introducing “Alexa Blueprints,” a new way for any Alexa owner to create their own customized Alexa skills or responses, without needing to know how to code. The idea is to allow Alexa owners to create their own voice apps, like a trivia game or bedtime stories, or teach Alexa to respond to questions with answers they design – like “Who’s the best mom in the world?,” for example. You could also create a skill that includes helpful information for the babysitter, which could be triggered by the command, “Alexa, open My Sitter,” Amazon suggests. “Alexa Skill Blueprints is an entirely new way for you to teach Alexa personalized skills just for you and your family,” explained Steve Rabuchin, Vice President, Amazon Alexa, in a statement about the launch. “You don’t need experience building skills or coding to get started—my family created our own jokes skill in a matter of minutes, and it’s been a blast to interact with Alexa in a totally new and personal way.” While Amazon's voice assistant has developed a number of skills over the years, it has not yet learned how to foretell the future. It has, however, learned how to give customized responses. See also on Snopes: Can Amazon’s Alexa Tell You How to Do CPR in an Emergency? Is Amazon’s Alexa Creepily Laughing for No Apparent Reason?

    "article_text": "Claim: Amazon’s Alexa predicted that World War III will begin on Nov. 23, 2023, with a Russian attack on Germany. Rating: False About this rating Amazon's voice assistant Alexa has many helpful skills but making predictions about future wars is not one of them. Nonetheless, a video went viral in February 2023, claiming to show an Alexa predicting the start of World War III. In the video, someone offscreen asks, \"Alexa, when will World War III start?\" In response the gadget supposedly says, \"World War III starts on November 23, 2023, at 6:05 p.m., when Russia launches an attack against Germany.\" This was not an actual prediction from the device; Alexa does not respond to such questions with that type of specificity. The video, which originates from TikTok, seemingly originated from an account known for posting fake Alexa responses to questions. The above video credits TikTok user @iamnoahbrendan. That account posted the clip in November 2021 and named another account, @jonbuckhouse, as the producer of the video's audio, or \"original sound.\" The video was available on @iamnoahbrendan's account , as of this writing. However, when we went to @jonbuckhouse's account, the clip of Alexa supposedly making the prediction about WWIII was no longer there. We reached out to both accounts to learn more and will update this story if we hear back. Citing metadata, Newsweek concluded that @jonbuckhouse appeared to be the footage's original source. That TikTok account has inspired fact-checking from Snopes in the past, particularly with its video of Alexa supposedly predicting that Miami will be \"completely destroyed\" by a hurricane in 2025. Similarly, in this video from 2020, Alexa supposedly stated, \"Today, President Donald Trump declared war on the rest of the world.\" That was clearly not an accurate statement: A March 2021 YouTube compilation of videos by @jonbuckhouse asking Alexa to predict events features the same question and answer about WWIII, at the 8:13 mark. Newsweek also reached out to an Amazon representative, who said of the alleged war prediction, \"This is not Alexa's response and we have not been able to replicate this video.\" The spokesperson added that Alexa's response to the question would be, \"There hasn't been a World War III and it's impossible to predict if such a war will happen in the future. World War I occurred from 1914-1918 and World War II occurred from 1939-1945.\" We asked Alexa the question, and she responded exactly as the spokesperson said she would. It is impossible to predict with accuracy the onset of a global conflict; only can humankind and its technology anticipate the possibilities of a world war based on tensions between nations. The video with the alleged WWIII prediction circulated just days after Russian President Vladimir Putin made a speech linking the Battle of Stalingrad during World War II — an unsuccessful attempt from Nazi Germany to capture Stalingrad — to the war in Ukraine. The possibility of a World War III has been suggested by world leaders and analysts when discussing the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In our past coverage of the TikTok account that posts fake Alexa responses, we noted, \"When you ask Alexa a question like this, the device will generally search online (Alexa's search engine is powered by Bing) for an answer.\" We also noted that people can use \"Alexa Blueprints,\" a tool introduced in 2018, to generate customizable answers to specific prompts. We thus know that Alexa could be programmed to respond to a certain question — for example, \"When will World War III start?\" — with a user-created answer. Amazon guidelines give instructions for how to do this, with examples of the kinds of questions and answers people can create: \"Alexa, who is the best mom?\" Alexa: I just compared all moms in history, and my conclusion is that yours is the best. \"Alexa, which is the best city in the world?\" Alexa: I'm pretty fond of my hometown, Seattle Washington. These answers would only be used by the individual Alexa device programmed to say such things, and would not apply to all Alexa voice assistants. We wrote previously , \"While Amazon's voice assistant has developed a number of skills over the years, it has not yet learned how to foretell the future. It has, however, learned how to give customized responses.\" This remains the case. We thus rate this claim as \"False.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: Amazon issued an update to a logo released in early 2021 after social media users compared the design to Adolf Hitler's mustache. Rating: Mostly True About this rating What's True Amazon released a new logo in early 2021 that depicted jagged blue tape positioned above an arrow to represent the company's tell-tale shipping boxes. Some social media users pointed out that the new design looked like a smirking Adolf Hitler, with the tape being his mustache and the arrow being his mouth. In a statement sent to Snopes, Amazon said that it updated its newly designed logo in response to customer feedback. What's Undetermined The technology giant but did not explicitly say whether the design change was related to users who compared the logo to Hitler’s mustache. A rollout of a new Amazon applications logo in early 2021 sparked online criticism after some social media users pointed out that the technology company’s tell-tale blue tape positioned above an arrow-like smile expressed similarities to a mustache worn by Adolf Hitler. And some social media users speculated that the American multinational e-commerce company promptly switched its redesign to counter online criticism, including The Guardian technology editor Alex Hern. The new icon for the application launched in the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands on iOS on Jan. 25 and worldwide on iOS on Feb 22. On Android, the icon launched on March 1. But the icon in question was in select countries, and according to an Amazon spokesperson, the company made changes to the original design based on customer feedback before it was rolled out worldwide. Amazon did not directly comment on whether the change was spurred by online comparisons to Hitler's mustache. Instead, a spokesperson sent Snopes the below comment: “Amazon is always exploring new ways to delight our customers,” they said. “We designed the new icon to spark anticipation, excitement, and joy when customers start their shopping journey on their phone, just as they do when they see our boxes on their doorstep.” This is the first update to the global mobile icon in more than five years and will be visible to customers once their phone applications are updated. It joins new functional updates to the app, including a new bottom navigation, simplified top navigation, and a new color scheme. “The mobile app icon is designed to be instantly recognizable to our customers around the world,” Amazon told Snopes in an email. “The new design features a brown delivery package and a hint of tape as the backdrop for the Amazon smile, which is now recognized around the world.”",

    "article_text": "Claim: Amazon recalled more than 350,000 Ring video doorbells sold in the U.S. and Canada because they can catch fire when rung. Rating: True About this rating Amazon-owned video doorbell manufacturer Ring has recalled more than 350,000 doorbells over concerns that the video doorbell’s battery can overheat and catch fire, posing fire and burn risks. This claim is true. About 350,000 second-generation doorbells (model number 5UM5E5) were recalled in the U.S. and an additional 8,700 in Canada on Nov. 10, 2020, according to a recall posted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ). Sold from June to October 2020 at home goods stores and online at Amazon.com, the two-way audio and video doorbell runs on a built-in rechargeable battery. The doorbell retails for around $100 and can be hardwired into an existing doorbell system and run via the internet. But when the incorrect screws are used in the installation, the battery can overheat and catch fire. The California-based home security company received at least 85 incident reports that described doorbells installed with incorrect screws and 23 of those doorbells igniting, resulting in minor property damage. Eight people reported minor burns. If you are a customer whose doorbell has been recalled you don't need to return the product, according to a statement on Ring's support page, but rather download new instructions for installing it. Customers can contact Ring here if they have any questions. To determine if a doorbell was included in the recall, the CSPC advised checking the serial and model numbers, which are located on the back of the doorbell and on its outer packaging: The model and serial number are printed on a label on the back of the doorbell (left) and on the product packaging (right). Do not buy or install video doorbells without reading the newly revised installation manual . Consumers can also check their doorbell’s serial number here . Only certain serial numbers are included in the recall.",

    "claim": "Amazon Sidewalk will automatically share Wi-Fi with neighbors without permission.",
    "rating": "Mixture",
    "article_text": "Claim: Amazon Sidewalk will automatically share Wi-Fi with neighbors without permission. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True When Amazon Sidewalk launches in June 2021, it will automatically opt in customers who use eligible Sidewalk Bridge devices. These devices share a portion of customers' Wi-Fi with other Sidewalk Bridge device owners, which will enable those devices to operate on the edge of home Wi-Fi range or out of range completely. However... What's False Amazon Sidewalk will not share Wi-Fi with neighbors who don't own eligible Sidewalk Bridge devices. Although customers will be automatically opted in initially, they can opt out any time. In late May 2021, Snopes readers emailed with questions about news reports that Amazon Sidewalk, a Wi-Fi-operated device network-sharing system being launched by online shopping mammoth Amazon, would automatically share Wi-Fi with neighbors without customers' permission. \"Trying to confirm validity of Amazon Sidewalk which could share some internet bandwidth with neighbors without permission,\" one reader wrote, for example. \"Is Amazon Sidewalk going to automatically share bandwidth with neighboring devices without permission?\" a second reader wrote. The truth is a bit nuanced. Yes, Amazon did opt in devices that are eligible for Amazon Sidewalk, but customers can likewise choose to opt out. And if you are on Amazon Sidewalk, that doesn't mean your Wi-Fi is shared with all of your neighbors. A small portion of Wi-Fi bandwidth will be shared only with other Amazon Sidewalk customers. We will explain more in detail below. What Is Amazon Sidewalk? Technology site CNET described Amazon Sidewalk as \"a long-range wireless network capable of keeping things connected even when they're outside the typical range of home Wi-Fi.\" According to Amazon : Amazon Sidewalk creates a low-bandwidth network with the help of Sidewalk Bridge devices including select Echo and Ring devices. These Bridge devices share a small portion of your internet bandwidth which is pooled together to provide these services to you and your neighbors. And when more neighbors participate, the network becomes even stronger. Sidewalk is intended to beef up Amazon's network of Wi-Fi-operated devices so that they will work even outside the range of the device owner's home Wi-Fi. Per CNET: On the Echo front, Amazon plans to leverage Sidewalk's low-energy Bluetooth connections as something of a backup network for your home Wi-Fi. Per Amazon, that means better stability during device setup and faster reconnections to your router when you update your network name or password. Ultimately, those Sidewalk connections will also help keep things like smart yard lights, mailbox sensors and connected garage door openers online, even if they sit on the fringes of your home's Wi-Fi network. At launch, your options for longer-range connections like those will include Ring's line of outdoor lights and cameras, the Level smart lock and Tile's Bluetooth tracker tags. Will Amazon Share Wi-Fi Without Permission? It's true that when Amazon Sidewalk goes live on June 8, 2021, customers that own eligible Sidewalk Bridge devices will be automatically opted in, initially. But they also have the option of opting out at any time. According to Amazon, Sidewalk Bridge devices provide connections to Amazon Sidewalk network, and these devices are: Ring Floodlight Cam (2019), Ring Spotlight Cam Wired (2019), Ring Spotlight Cam Mount (2019), Echo (3rd gen and newer), Echo Dot (3rd gen and newer), Echo Dot for Kids (3rd gen and newer), Echo Dot with Clock (3rd gen and newer), Echo Plus (all generations), Echo Show (all models and generations), Echo Spot, Echo Studio, Echo Input, Echo Flex. Amazon spokesman Jeremy Bartram told Snopes in an email that the company began notifying Amazon customers with eligible devices, so they could evaluate whether they wanted to change their preferences before Amazon Sidewalk goes online. Will Amazon Sidewalk Share Wi-Fi with neighbors? Yes, but not all neighbors and only a small portion of your Wi-Fi bandwidth. According to Amazon, Sidewalk will enable Wi-Fi sharing only between customers who own Sidewalk-connected Amazon devices. It will also share a fraction of a customer's Wi-Fi. Bartram told us that, \"when you share your Bridge’s connection with Sidewalk, total monthly data used by Sidewalk, per account, is capped at 500MB, which is equivalent to streaming about 10 minutes of high definition video.\" Bartram said Amazon took multiple security measures including three layers of encryption on data and measures to prevent customers from viewing other customers' data.

    "article_text": "Claim: A new technology known as “anti-solar panels” could one day produce energy at night from deep space in much the same way that solar panels operate during the day. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True A technology known as thermoradiative photovoltaics could one day harvest electrical energy from the night sky in much the same way that solar panels tap energy from the sky, according to research published in a 2020 concept paper. What's Undetermined At the time of this writing, such technology does not exist on the market, nor has it been made available to the public for broader energy production. Published work describing the “anti-solar panels” was purely theoretical in nature. A new technology touted as having the ability to harvest energy from the night sky may some day bridge gaps left by solar energy. That's according to researchers at the University of California Davis who designed so-called “anti-solar panels” and described them in a 2020 concept in the peer-reviewed scientific journal ACS Photonics. The idea took steam again on the internet on Feb. 20, 2021, when British internet media company Unilad published an article describing the “anti-solar panels” that could “generate power at night.” Traditional solar panels are made up of small photovoltaic, or solar, cells. These electrical components generate electricity through the absorption of light. By taking this technology and flipping it, the researchers said the potential exists to generate about 50 watts of power per square meter — about a quarter of that generated by a conventional solar panel in the daytime. Ultimately, small photovoltaic cells in a solar panel deliver power because the radiation source, the sun, is very hot and the solar cell, in comparison, is cool. The solar panel thus attracts energy from the sun to convert it into electrical power. But photovoltaics can only generate electricity during daylight hours. So, how can solar technology be deployed to produce electrical power after the sun has set? It's a new field known as radiative cooling, and the technology was described in a concept paper, so it's important to note that it is theoretical in nature. But under this theory, an object that is hot compared to its surroundings will radiate heat as infrared light. The sun is hot, so heat from it radiates to a conventional solar cell on Earth, which is cooler in comparison. Thermoradiative photovoltaics uses this same concept to traditionally absorb heat from surrounding hot objects, like a generator’s cooling tower or an engine's exhaust pipe, and convert it into energy. A conventional photovoltaic or solar cell (left) absorbs photons of light from the sun and generates an electrical current. A thermoradiative cell (right) generates electrical current as it radiates heat toward the extreme cold of deep space. Tristan Deppe, Jeremy Munday/ UC Davis But the theory proposed by UC Davis researchers turns thermoradiative panels on Earth into these so-called hot objects and quite literally points them at a cold object, for example, the night sky. Space is cold, so a warm object pointed at the night sky will radiate heat toward it to convert heat into electricity through photons, or light cells. “A regular solar cell generates power by absorbing sunlight, which causes a voltage to appear across the device and for current to flow. In these new devices, light is instead emitted and the current and voltage go in the opposite direction, but you still generate power,” said lead researcher Jeremy Munday in a university news release at the time. “You have to use different materials, but the physics is the same.” Humans have been using similar technologies for thousands of years in design choices for their structures. For example, indigenous communities in the Southwest have created adobe homes that slowly warm up during the day and give off heat at night to regulate the interior heat. In more modern times, white paint is used to coat the roofs of buildings to reflect sunlight and reduce heat during the day. And though the actual device has not yet been developed, researchers concluded that generating carbon-neutral power at night will help in the global push for carbon neutrality, paving way for new technologies that can produce clean energy around the clock.",

As violence erupted in the Capitol, photographs and videos showing Trump supporters wearing Trump merchandise and waving Trump flags were widely circulated on social media. In the aftermath of that chaotic day, which was widely condemned by world leaders, business leaders, and even some of the politicians who egged these people on , an attempt was made to shift the narrative and place the blame for the violence onto the shoulders of antifa (anti-fascist activists). Some claimed, for instance, that a man in a Viking helmet who stormed the Capitol had previously attended a Black Lives Matter rally. While photographs truly show this person at both events, this person is not a member of antifa. This person has been identified as Jake Angeli, a Trump supporter who is sometimes referred to as the \"QAnon Shaman.\" Angeli is a known Trump supporter and was identified by QAnon reporters such as Travis View . Additionally, Newsweek reported that Angeli responded to rumors that he was connected to antifa on Twitter, writing: Mr. Wood. I am not antifa or blm. I'm a Qanon & digital soldier ... My name is Jake & I marched with the police & fought against BLM & ANTIFA in PHX. Look up OAN's coverage of July 4ths rally in PHX capital. I was standing against the BLM mob out numbered but unphased. The other big piece of \"evidence\" used to support the claim that antifa had spurred on the violence in D.C. came from another photograph of a Trump supporter in the U.S. Capitol. In that case, social media users claimed that a tattoo on this person's hand proved he was antifa. For one, the hammer and sickle is not a symbol that is inherently tied to antifa. While Trump supporters frequently paint antifa as \"communists,\" the one belief that ties this leaderless group together is that they are, as their name implies, against fascism. More importantly, this person's tattoo is not a hammer and sickle. This is actually the \"outsiders mark\" from the video game Dishonored 2. These claims were both easily proven false. However, they were given the appearance of credibility when they were rehashed in an article by The Washington Times about a facial recognition software company. The Washington Times published an article on Jan. 7 claiming that a \"retired military officer told The Washington Times that the firm XRVision used its software to do facial recognition of protesters and matched two Philadelphia Antifa members to two men inside the Senate.\" There were a number of red flags in this article. For one, although The Washington Times claimed that this anonymous source gave them photographs, they did not publish these alleged images. Furthermore, while this website claimed that \"facial recognition software\" was used to make these identifications, the first example given is about the aforementioned person's hand tattoo. The website does not actually identify this person. Instead, they base the claim that this person is a member of antifa entirely on the misidentified marking. The Washington Times wrote: \"One has a tattoo that indicates he is a Stalinist sympathizer. Many Antifa members promote anarchy through violence and want the end of America in favor of a Stalinist-state. 'No more USA at all' is a protest chant.\" The second example provided by The Washington Times also appears to simply rehash the previously debunked social media rumor about the QAnon Shaman. Additionally, The Washington Times notes that this person is \"not known to have Antifa links.\" The website wrote: \"XRVision also has identified another man who, while not known to have Antifa links, is someone who shows up at climate and Black Lives Matter protests in the West.\" Lastly, XRVision has called The Washington Times' article \"outright false.\" Buzzfeed News reported that XRVision's software had actually identified \"two members of neo-Nazi organizations and a QAnon supporter among the pro-Trump mob,\" not members of antifa. XRVision has since called for The Washington Times to retract its story and issue an apology. Buzzfeed News writes: An attorney representing XRVision, which says it was founded in 2015 in Singapore, issued a statement to BuzzFeed News refuting the Washington Times story. The statement said XRVision's software actually identified two members of neo-Nazi organizations and a QAnon supporter among the pro-Trump mob — not antifa members. [...] \"XRVision didn't generate any composites or detection imagery for the Washington Times nor for a 'retired military officer' and did not authorize them to make any such representations,\" the statement said. \"The image analysis that we performed were distributed to a handful of individuals for their private consumption and not for publication. XRVision takes pride in its technology's precision and deems the Washington Times publication as outright false, misleading, and defamatory.\" The Washington Times has since deleted their article.

    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: Meta has started adding tags to some social media posts, claiming,\"This user is suspected of being part of a terrorist organization called Antifa. Please report any suspicious behavior.\" Rating: False About this rating A rumor circulated online in late September 2025 that Meta, the corporation which owns social media platforms Facebook, Threads and Instagram, started tagging certain Threads users as members of \"Antifa,\" a colloquial term used for a political movement and ideology opposing fascism. Users across social media platforms like Instagram ( archived ), Facebook ( archived ) and particularly Threads ( archived , archived ), claimed certain users saw their posts being tagged with a notice that read, \"This user is suspected of being part of a terrorist organization called Antifa. Please report any suspicious behavior.\" View on Threads The prevalence of the rumor led many Snopes readers to email us asking for clarification on the rumor and whether Meta was actually responsible for the purported tags. However, the rumor that Meta added tags to social media posts and declared certain users as \"part of a terrorist organization called Antifa\" was false. Snopes contacted Meta and a representative confirmed via email that the tag is a user-generated meme and not populated by the company. Further, there was no mention of the company announcing any such feature on its newsroom website that regularly updates users on new features. In addition, the only mention of \"Antifa\" in Meta's newsroom came from a post, titled, \"An Update to How We Address Movements and Organizations Tied to Violence,\" dated Aug. 19, 2020. The post described Meta's efforts to combat alleged encouragement of violence surrounding protests that occurred during the summer of 2020. The statement included a section that read, \"For militia organizations and those encouraging riots, including some who may identify as Antifa, we've initially removed over 980 groups, 520 Pages and 160 ads from Facebook.\" The post also identified the removal of similar pages and groups related to the fringe conspiracy theory known as QAnon , though Snopes reporting from 2021 showed plenty of QAnon content still featured on Meta platforms. The meme allegedly identifying users as \"Antifa\" appeared to be a response to U.S. President Donald Trump signing an executive order declaring \"Antifa as a terrorist threat.\" The executive order stated, \"Antifa is a militarist, anarchist enterprise that explicitly calls for the overthrow of the United States Government, law enforcement authorities, and our system of law.\" Further, the executive order suggested a conspiracy to conceal the reality of an \"Antifa\" organization, declaring: Antifa recruits, trains, and radicalizes young Americans to engage in this violence and suppression of political activity, then employs elaborate means and mechanisms to shield the identities of its operatives, conceal its funding sources and operations in an effort to frustrate law enforcement, and recruit additional members. In contrast to the Trump administration alleging that \"Antifa\" is an organized entity, Luke Baumgartner, a research fellow with George Washington University's Program on Extremism, told PBS in an interview that the movement was a \"political scapegoat,\" and said, \"simply put, Antifa is just short for anti-fascist. If you want to get more simple than that it just means the opposition to fascism.\" He continued to say that the notion of an organized \"Antifa\" is \"a widely held misconception\" by political opponents. Baumgartner explained, \"There is no hierarchical organizational structure. It is primarily a movement and an ideology. And there are no leaders. There are no assets. There are no bank accounts or revenue streams to go after, either.\" Due to these conflicting opinions on the nature of \"Antifa,\" users on social media started posting the fake disclaimer along with otherwise innocuous posts as a satirical joke intended to mock Trump and fellow conservatives' belief that \"Antifa\" was a threat to democracy. For example, one Threads user posted ( archived ) \"Pumpkin pie is good\" and included the purported tag.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Apple disabled directions to Washington, D.C., in preparation for Jan. 6 protests against the certification of the 2020 presidential election. Rating: False About this rating On Jan. 5, 2021, several pro-Trump pundits began tweeting a rumor that Apple disabled their iPhone's map application from providing directions to Washington, D.C., implying it was an attempt by the company to suppress participation in protests planned to coincide with Congressional certification of the 2020 U.S. presidential election: We reached out to Apple on Twitter, but have not yet received a response to our inquiry about this rumor. Regardless, there is no evidence that the screenshots, if authentic, represent anything other than a bug or user error. Stephanie Hamill, an OANN host, tweeted that \"it’s now working\" an hour after claiming Apple maps was blocking her from getting directions to D.C., for example. That the issue corrected itself suggests no intent on the part of Apple to block information due to the protests. At the time of this reporting, a day later, we have had no problem getting directions to the nation's capital with Apple Maps, even as a curfew descends on the city following an unprecedented riot that saw members of Congress evacuated from their chambers. If the notifications shown in these tweets are genuine, one potential explanation is that the pin location used is placed on, or defaulted to, one of the many roads closed in anticipation of the protests. If so, such a bug appears to have resolved itself by 4:43 p.m. EST on Jan 5. 2021, well before the protests began. As such, we rank the claim \"False.\"",

    "claim": "Apple is adding OpenAI’s generative artificial intelligence program ChatGPT to every iPhone, and will use it to analyze personal data &quot;like never before.&quot;",
    "rating": "Mixture",
    "article_text": "Claim: Apple is adding OpenAI’s generative artificial intelligence program ChatGPT to every iPhone, and will use it to analyze personal data \"like never before.\" Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True Apple is adding integrated ChatGPT access to particular iPhone models, and if users don't opt out, their data and queries when using ChatGPT could be used by parent company OpenAI to help train its artificial intelligence models. However ... What's False ChatGPT and Apple Intelligence, Apple's new personalized AI features, will only be available on newer devices, not all devices as is claimed. Further, Apple said it would protect user data by using a combination of on-device processing and secure external processing called Private Cloud Compute that would not store any user data. In early October 2024, a rumor circulated on social media that tech giant Apple is adding ChatGPT , a generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) program, to every iPhone. One X account claimed: \"Apple is adding chat GPT to every iPhone, meaning your personal data is about to be analyzed like never before.\" (@Illuminatibot on X) Another user replied : \"I'm shocked that anyone would still be using 'smart' phones. NOTHING on your home computer, let alone your phone, is safe or secure when you have a smartphone.\" In sum, it is indeed true that Apple is integrating GenAI, including ChatGPT, into their products. However, not \"every iPhone\" will be impacted by the rollout, therefore this claim contains a mixture of true and false information. What Is True? Apple Intelligence Launch At their Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2024, the company announced Apple Intelligence , which they described as \"the personal intelligence system that combines the power of generative models with users' personal context — at the core of iPhone, iPad, and Mac to deliver intelligence that's incredibly useful and relevant.\" Apple has not confirmed an exact release date, but news agency Bloomberg reported the update would go live on Oct. 28, 2024. Regarding which devices Apple Intelligence will be available on, Apple stated : Apple Intelligence will be available as a free software update. The first set of Apple Intelligence features will be available in beta next month as part of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1, with more features rolling out in the months to come. It will be available on iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPad and Mac with M1 and later, with device and Siri language set to U.S. English. Additional languages and platforms are coming over the course of the next year. CNN said Apple Intelligence — the collective brand name for the corporation's AI tools — is \"intended to be more of a personal assistant than anything else, with an emphasis on 'personal.'\" The article added: It takes in specific information about your relationships and contacts, messages and emails you've sent, events you've been to, meetings on your calendar and other highly individualized bits of data about your life. And then it uses that data to, Apple hopes, make your life a little easier — helping you dig up a photo you took from that concert years ago, finding the right attachment to put on an email, or ranking your mobile notifications by priority and urgency. ChatGPT Integration As part of the broader AI initiative, Apple is indeed introducing a partnership with OpenAI , the company behind ChatGPT, a GenAI chatbot. While Apple Intelligence is focused on the personalized user experience, third-party ChatGPT's integration is intended to give users faster access to the GenAI chatbot tool, which assists with more extensive searches, prompts, or the composition of documents that require knowledge beyond the users' personal experience. Apple stated : With ChatGPT from OpenAI integrated into Siri and Writing Tools, you get even more expertise when it might be helpful for you — no need to jump between tools. Siri can tap into ChatGPT for certain requests, including questions about photos or documents. And with Compose in Writing Tools, you can create and illustrate original content from scratch. You control when ChatGPT is used and will be asked before any of your information is shared. Anyone can access ChatGPT for free, without creating an account. ChatGPT subscribers can connect accounts to access paid features within these experiences. Elsewhere, the corporation said : \" For users who choose to access ChatGPT through Siri or Writing Tools, privacy protections are built in — their IP addresses are obscured, and OpenAI won't store requests ... ChatGPT's data-use policies apply for those who choose to connect their account.\" Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said in a June 10, 2024, news release : \"Apple shares our commitment to safety and innovation, and this partnership aligns with OpenAI's mission to make advanced AI accessible to everyone. Together with Apple, we're making it easier for people to benefit from what AI can offer.\" Therefore, it is true that Apple is integrating ChatGPT into their Apple Intelligence products , but only for more recent models of their devices. What Requires More Context? The claim that customer data will be \"analyzed like never before\" requires additional context. A statement from the tech giant, in which it said it will treat user data with the utmost care, opposed this element of the claim: \"Apple Intelligence is designed to protect users' privacy at every step. A cornerstone of Apple Intelligence is on-device processing, and many of the models that power it run entirely on device.\" This technology will ensure users' data \"is never stored or shared with Apple,\" the company added, \"i t is used only to fulfill their request.\" However, data privacy does get murkier with Apple Intelligence's expanded features due to the optional integration of ChatGPT. Apple claimed to be taking measures to protect customer data and to only use it for its personalized Apple Intelligence features, saying: \"You control when ChatGPT is used and will be asked before any of your information is shared. Anyone can access ChatGPT for free, without creating an account. ChatGPT subscribers can connect accounts to access paid features within these experiences.\" However, when a user connects their device to ChatGPT for expanded functionality, they are then agreeing to ChatGPT's liberal use of t heir customer data. OpenAI's data-use policy reads in part: We continuously improve our models through research breakthroughs as well as exposure to real-world problems and data. When you share your content with us, it helps our models become more accurate and better at solving your specific problems and it also helps improve their general capabilities and safety. We don't use your content to market our services or create advertising profiles of you — we use it to make our models more helpful. ChatGPT, for instance, improves by further training on the conversations people have with it, unless you opt out. Opting out of ChatGPT's AI training is possible , and can be done by going into your ChatGPT account settings on iOS or the web, selecting Data Controls and disabling the default \"Improve the model for everyone\" option. This setting syncs between devices, according to OpenAI. Therefore, Apple said the company will not be analyzing customer data through their Apple Intelligence products, but once a user agrees to OpenAI's terms in order to use ChatGPT, their data when using that specific tool could be accessed. Snopes has covered GenAI at length, including ChatGPT declining to write a poem admiring Donald Trump, and a slew of AI-generated photographs allegedly depicting a little girl holding a puppy during Hurricane Helene, a Fisher-Price play set called \" My First Dealer Kit ,\" and \" the last, giant Irish Greyhound .\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: In August 2021, Apple announced plans to begin scanning iPhones in the United States for child sexual abuse material. Rating: True About this rating Context In September 2021, after this article was originally published, Apple announced it was postponing the commencement of the child sexual abuse images scanning project, but still intended to implement those plans, albeit after taking time to \"collect input and make improvements.\" In August 2021, news outlets reported that Apple was considering the implementation of plans to scan iCloud photographs for child sexual abuse imagery. For example, on Aug. 5 the Financial Times published an article with the headline \"Apple plans to scan US iPhones for child abuse imagery.\" The piece stated that: Apple intends to install software on American iPhones to scan for child abuse imagery, according to people briefed on its plans, raising alarm among security researchers who warn that it could open the door to surveillance of millions of people’s personal devices. Apple detailed its proposed system — known as “neuralMatch” — to some U.S. academics earlier this week, according to two security researchers briefed on the virtual meeting. The plans could be publicised more widely as soon as this week, they said. The technology website Engadget published a similar article, later that day, with the headline \"Apple reportedly plans to begin scanning iPhones in the US for child abuse images.\" On Aug. 5, Apple itself confirmed that it was planning to introduce a new system of \"on-device matching\" between photographs stored on Apple devices, and a library of known child abuse \"image hashes\" — a king of photographic fingerprinting — in order to report photographs that are highly likely to show child abuse, to law enforcement agencies. In a statement , Apple said the new system would be rolled out later in 2021, through updates to iOS 15, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8 and macOS Monterey. The company explained: ...New technology in iOS and iPadOS will allow Apple to detect known CSAM [child sexual abuse material] images stored in iCloud Photos. This will enable Apple to report these instances to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). NCMEC acts as a comprehensive reporting center for CSAM and works in collaboration with law enforcement agencies across the United States. Apple’s method of detecting known CSAM is designed with user privacy in mind. Instead of scanning images in the cloud, the system performs on-device matching using a database of known CSAM image hashes provided by NCMEC and other child safety organizations... Before an image is stored in iCloud Photos, an on-device matching process is performed for that image against the known CSAM hashes. This matching process is powered by a cryptographic technology called private set intersection, which determines if there is a match without revealing the result. If the photo in question exceeds a threshold of similarity with known child sexual abuse imagery, as determined algorithmically, it would then be forwarded to Apple itself, where a real human being will interpret the image and decide whether or not to forward it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. According to Apple, the matching process is so accurate and the algorithmic threshold so high that in any given year, the probability that the algorithm will incorrectly flag an innocuous photo is less than \"one in one trillion.\" The news reports highlighted above were accurate at the time they were published, in early August 2021, but on Sep. 3, Apple said it was postponing its implementation of the project. In a statement , the company wrote: Previously we announced plans for features intended to help protect children from predators who use communication tools to recruit and exploit them and to help limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material. Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers, and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features. Significantly, Apple indicated that it still ultimately intends to implement its plans, even though the timeline for that has changed and the final details might change somewhat. As a result, the claim that Apple had announced its intention to begin scanning U.S. iPhones for child sexual abuse material remained accurate, and we are retaining the rating of \"True.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: Apple's software update shut off the emergency alert system on iPhones so U.S. President Donald Trump can't text his supporters. Rating: False About this rating In the days following a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump on Jan. 6, 2021, Snopes readers asked for verification of online rumors that an unspecified Apple software update would remove the emergency alert system on iPhones. This is a false rumor that appears to have originated with Lin Wood, an attorney and Trump ally with a track record of making false and incendiary statements . Wood rose to prominence by making inflammatory and false public statements. He was one of the most vocal promoters of Trump's months-long disinformation campaign claiming falsely the November 2020 presidential election was beset by fraud, and that Trump, who lost, actually won. Wood also has a habit of making extremely incendiary remarks, like calling for the execution Vice President Mike Pence. Wood stated on the social media platform Parler that the Apple update would shut off the emergency broadcast system so that Trump couldn't use the system to send text messages to his supporters after being banned from various social media platforms. Trump has been banned, most notably, from Twitter and Facebook among other platforms, over fears he would incite further violence. During the attack on the Capitol, five people were killed, including a Capitol police officer who was beaten to death and a Trump supporter who was shot and killed by police when she tried to breach a barricaded door. Pence and members of Congress were evacuated from House and Senate chambers within hair-raising seconds before rioters reached them, some of whom stated they wanted to kill some of them. Parler is currently down because because Amazon booted it from its web hosting service over posts threatening further violence. But we archived the cached version of Wood's posts about the emergency broadcast system: \"Apple is going to do an update on all phones to shut off the emergency broadcast system. This is Nazi Germany 1938,\" Wood's post states. \"Turn your auto update toggle off.\" Wood had also stated on Parler that Trump supporters should \"BE PREPARED FOR AN IMMINENT BLACKOUT,\" in which event Trump would have used the emergency broadcast system to send messages to his supporters. Apple banned Parler, a platform favored by Trump supporters and right-wing extremists, from its iPhone app store, and Google Play banned it from downloads onto Android phones. But Apple didn't remove emergency alerts in its most recent updates. iPhone users, however, do have the option of turning these alerts off if they don't wish to receive them. The emergency broadcast system is for public-safety purposes and is where officials can convey important safety-related information to residents affected by an emergency. It can also be used by the U.S. president in the event of a national emergency, and can be \"used when all other means of alerting the public are unavailable,\" per FEMA's website.",

    "rating": "True",
    "article_text": "Claim: Researchers at Michigan State University created transparent solar panels that have the potential to power buildings and can be retrofitted to older glass exteriors or windows. Rating: True About this rating Fact Check Researchers at Michigan State University (MSU) developed a prototype of a transparent solar panel they say could one day be applied to windows and glass exteriors to provide power to buildings. Though the technology is still largely in the prototype phase as of this writing, the technology has been installed on at least one campus building. Our team was first clued into the novel solar panels when we came across a meme shared to Facebook on April 7, 2022 . It read: \"A professor at Michigan State University has created the first transparent solar panel, that have the potential to power entire buildings and can be retrofitted to older glass buildings or even windows.\" A look through university news releases confirmed that the claim was true. The “solar harvesting system” employs small organic molecules held within the pane to absorb and capture wavelengths of sunlight that are invisible to the human eye, such as ultraviolet and near-infrared. This light is then guided to the edge of the plastic where it is converted into electricity through strips of photovoltaic solar cells. A video posted by MSU showed the transparent solar-harvesting panel powering a small fan, noting that the technology works by absorbing invisible wavelengths of sunlight to convert the energy to electricity. Development of the panels began in 2014 when a team of researchers at MSU created a “transparent luminescent solar concentrator” that could be placed over a clear surfaces to create solar energy. The technology was novel in that it was one of the first renditions that utilized transparent materials as opposed to those that were highly colored. The findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Advanced Optical Materials . In October 2017, MSU announced that the see-through solar materials represented a “massive source of untapped energy” that may one day “harvest as much power as bigger, bulkier rooftop solar units.” They would work by lining the exterior vertical surfaces of buildings and when used in conjunction with traditional rooftop, could help to meet U.S. electricity demand. “Highly transparent solar cells represent the wave of the future for new solar applications,” said Richard Lunt, a professor at MSU, in a news release at the time. “We analyzed their potential and show that by harvesting only invisible light, these devices can provide a similar electricity-generation potential as rooftop solar while providing additional functionality to enhance the efficiency of buildings, automobiles and mobile electronics.” Eventually, the researchers hope that their technology will be incorporated into the initial design and construction of new buildings, as well as to retrofit older buildings.",

    "claim": "The Australian government introduced a &quot;social credit system&quot; that requires people to access the internet via a digital ID. ",
    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: The Australian government introduced a \"social credit system\" that requires people to access the internet via a digital ID. Rating: False About this rating In mid-December 2022, assertions that the Australian government had — or had planned to — introduce a \"social credit\" system requiring people to access the internet \"via your digital ID\" went viral. These claims mixed proposed-but-never-enacted legislation in Australia with language long associated with digital ID conspiracy theories. One iteration of this claim on Twitter asserted that access to the internet would require users to produce identifying documents to social media companies: AUSTRALIA - Social credit introduced to access the internet, via your digital ID. Citizens need 100 points of identification to use social media & the police will have access to your accounts including private messaging. Goodbye freedom. Hello tyranny. A similar claim , also on Twitter, asserted similar examples of purported government overreach by Australia in the social media space: Reminder - The Australian federal government is planning to de-anonymize the internet to introduce a social credit system to combat \"online abuse\" - police will have access to individuals' social media accounts, which will be linked to people's passports. Despite claiming to depict a recent or current development, both of these viral tweets were based on the same video of an April 1, 2021, broadcast by the the news program 9 News Australia: That segment specifically discussed a recommendation — one of many — made by the Australian House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs as part of an \"inquiry into family, domestic and sexual violence.\" Among other things, that committee's report , released the same day as the 9 News Australia broadcast, made these policy recommendations: In order to open or maintain an existing social media account, customers should be required by law to identify themselves to a platform using 100 points of identification, in the same way as a person must provide identification for a mobile phone account, or to buy a mobile SIM card. Social media platforms must provide those identifying details when requested by the eSafety Commissioner, law enforcement or as directed by a court. These recommendations were never included in any subsequent Australian social media or internet legislation. A bill that passed both chambers of the Australian parliament and signed into law in September 2021 did provide Australian law enforcement with new forms of warrants capable of gathering information on digital crimes. But this legislation did not place new requirements on the tech industry and did not concern the newly enacted position of eSafety Commissioner . The reference in the viral claim about \"social credit\" appears meant to invoke comparisons to dystopian science fiction and/or the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In 2014, the CCP introduced plans for a \"social credit\" system that tracked individuals' moral behavior along with more commonly understood concepts involved in financial credit. As described in the MIT Technology Review in 2022: Back in 2014, the plan [in China] was to have a national system tracking all \"social credit\" ready by 2020. Now it's almost 2023, and the long-anticipated legal framework for the system was just released in the November 2022 draft law. That said, the government has mostly figured out the financial part. The zhengxin system—first released to the public in 2006 and significantly updated in 2020—is essentially the Chinese equivalent of American credit bureaus' scoring and is maintained by the country's central bank. It records the financial history of 1.14 billion Chinese individuals (and gives them credit scores), as well as almost 100 million companies (though it doesn't give them scores). On the social side, however, regulations have been patchy and vague. To date, the national government has built only a system focused on companies, not individuals, which aggregates data on corporate regulation compliance from different government agencies. Digital identity legislation, and the concept of a \"digital ID\" in general, has been a lightning rod for conspiracy theorists, as Snopes discussed in a June 2020 article about the ID2020 coalition. The language used in the viral tweets appears to target those audiences. The evidence cited to support allegations that Australia is requiring social media companies to hold onto identifying information, and in some cases transmit it to law enforcement, stems from an out-of-date television news segment discussing legislative proposals that never advanced. As such, claims that the Australian government introduced a social credit system requiring people to access the internet via your digital ID are \"False.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: Instagram flagged a reposted tweet from Bernice King about her father, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., on Jan. 18, 2021, which is MLK Day, for misinformation pertaining to the COVID-19 vaccine. Rating: True About this rating On Jan. 18, 2021 — also known as MLK Day in commemoration of late civil rights leader the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. — his daughter Bernice King posted a message on Twitter that quickly went viral. King's post bemoaned how the praise received after her father's death did not reflect how he was treated in his life. She said: A number of people shared this tweet on MLK Day in the form of a screenshot on numerous social media accounts including on Instagram, where many posted it again on Instagram stories. They also noticed something unusual: Instagram had flagged their story with a note saying, “See why this may be misleading.” According to these users , clicking on the note led to a post stating “False Information: Leading health organizations say information in this post may mislead people about vaccines.” Evidently, since the post itself had nothing to do with vaccines, some users assumed that there was a glitch, while others claimed this was Instagram’s attempt at censorship. We spoke to Instagram user alexys_davis who saw the flag go up on their account on MLK Day after reposting the King tweet. The flag remained on the story all day, according to this user. When we checked again on Jan. 21, the user said that the flag was no longer there, and we verified this by sharing the same post on a personal account. Since Instagram stories disappear after 24 hours, we could only rely on screenshots from MLK Day as evidence that such flagging had indeed occurred. We reached out to Facebook — Instagram's parent company — and received confirmation from a spokesperson for Instagram that those posts had indeed been flagged on that day. “Our systems mistakenly labeled screenshots of this Tweet as vaccine misinformation,” said Raki Wane. “We have now removed the incorrect label on these posts.” Given that Facebook/Instagram confirmed that King’s tweet had been temporarily flagged due to an error in their system, we rate this claim as “True.”",

    "rating": "True",
    "article_text": "Claim: Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is building a $42 million clock that will keep time for 10,000 years. Rating: True About this rating For years now, claims that Amazon founder and billionaire Jeff Bezos is building a \"10,000 Year Clock\" that cost him $42 million have been posted to social media sites like Reddit and X (formerly Twitter). A 2020 post on Reddit obtained 5,100 upvotes and 1,100 comments: (Reddit Screenshot) The X post below, dated March 30, 2023, was seen 5.3 million times: (@DailyLoud / X) The claim also showed up on TikTok. One video explaining the project gained 154,000 views. 'The Long Now' The story of the 10,000-year clock began in 1995, when computer scientist and inventor Danny Hillis published an essay in Wired magazine's issue titled \" Wired Scenarios: The Future Future .\" In it, he wrote : I want to build a clock that ticks once a year. The century hand advances once every one hundred years, and the cuckoo comes out on the millennium. I want the cuckoo to come out every millennium for the next 10,000 years. If I hurry I should finish the clock in time to see the cuckoo come out for the first time. … Ten thousand years — the life span I hope for the clock — is about as long as the history of human technology. We have fragments of pots that old. Geologically, it's a blink of an eye. Hillis also explained that he discussed the idea of the clock with several people, including artist and musician Brian Eno, who gave it a name: \"The Clock of the Long Now.\" Attempting to lay out his motivation for building the clock, Hillis added: Here is a part of me that I want to preserve, and maybe the clock is my way of explaining it to you: I cannot imagine the future, but I care about it. I know I am a part of a story that starts long before I can remember and continues long beyond when anyone will remember me. I sense that I am alive at a time of important change, and I feel a responsibility to make sure that the change comes out well. I plant my acorns knowing that I will never live to harvest the oaks. The following year, in 1996, Hillis and his friend Stewart Brand, who used to edit The Whole Earth Catalog , founded The Long Now Foundation , which aims to \"foster long-term thinking.\" The founders define \"the long now\" as a span of 20,000 years and \"hope to help each other be good ancestors\" and \"preserve possibilities for the future.\" Hillis and Bezos had been friend for years, according to Wired . Bezos, like Hillis, was used to thinking about the long term. He had already lent his backing to another Long Now project, known as Long Bets , which encourages people to make long-term predictions ( Warren Buffett , among others, participated). In 2005, the two friends began to discuss the idea to build this clock. The Clock In December 2011, Bezos published a first update on the construction of the 10,000 Year Clock. He explained a team of engineers had bored a 500-foot-deep hole into the Sierra Diablo mountain range in Texas, on land that he owns. A view of Sierra Diablo mountain range land owned by Amazon.Com founder Jeff Bezos. (James Nielsen / Houston Chronicle via Getty Images) On the 10,000 Year Clock website, Bezos provided more details about the conception of the clock, explaining that he and The Long Now Foundation were hoping to make it a collaborative project with people in the future: Carved into the mountain are five room-sized anniversary chambers: 1 year, 10 year, 100 year, 1,000 year, and 10,000 year anniversaries. The one year anniversary chamber is a special orrery. In addition to the planets and the Earth's moon, it includes the interplanetary probes launched during the 20th century. The Clock will activate and run the orrery once a year on a pre-determined date at solar noon. We aren't planning to build the animations for the 100, 1,000, and 10,000 year anniversary chambers, but will instead leave those to future generations. We are providing a mechanical interface into those chambers that provides those future builders with power and the correct Clock triggering events. In 2018, Bezos announced on X ( archived ) that the installation of the clock mechanism had begun inside the shaft, adding a video: Installation has begun—500 ft tall, all mechanical, powered by day/night thermal cycles, synchronized at solar noon, a symbol for long-term thinking—the #10000YearClock is coming together thx to the genius of Danny Hillis, Zander Rose & the whole Clock team! Enjoy the video. pic.twitter.com/FYIyaUIbdJ — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) February 20, 2018 $42 Million? In June 2011, Bezos told Wired that he would invest $42 million in the clock. This is the number that has been used in successive reporting on the project, up to December 2023. As of this writing, no updates to this figure have been reported.",

Rating: Correct Attribution About this rating Context The comment stems from a letter to Amazon shareholders in 1999, discussing the company's philosophical approach to its customer relationships and the importance of employee productivity. A good manager always finds ways to motivate employees, but according to one claim circulating online, Amazon founder and billionaire Jeff Bezos had a rather unorthodox method for doing so. The claim alleged that Bezos once said he tells his employees to \"wake up terrified every morning.\" One video shared on TikTok ( archived ) in late 2024 featured an excerpt from an interview with Martha Beck , a self-described \"bestselling author, coach and speaker,\" from an episode of the podcast \"The Diary of a CEO.\" In the clip, Beck said: I was amazed to find that Jeff Bezos, one of the richest men in the world, says in his quarterly reports and loves to say, in many settings, that he tells all of the thousands of Amazon employees who work under him… he wants them all to wake up terrified every morning. And that's the word he uses: terrified. And to stay terrified all day, because that makes them productive. But most of these people are just getting by financially. He wants them to be afraid all the time so that he and the stockholders can get more stuff. And they already have so much stuff! The TikTok user sharing the clip added a caption that read, \"No one deserves this, you are worth so much and don't need to live in fear.\" As of this writing, this TikTok has been shared nearly 10,000 times. Other users chimed in on the claim across social media platforms, including Instagram ( archived ), X ( archived ) and Threads ( archived ). Bezos did indeed once say that he tells employees to \"wake up terrified every morning,\" but the available evidence suggests a different context than Beck intimates . In an interview with CNET from 1999, available to watch on YouTube , interviewer Wendy Walsh asked Bezos around the 1:16 mark, \"I heard you once say that you told your staff members to be afraid of your customers. What does that mean?\" Bezos' response is: Well, I ask everybody around here to wake up terrified every morning through sheets drenched in sweat. But to be very precise about what it is they're afraid of. And they shouldn't be afraid of our competitors. They should be afraid of our customers. Because those are the folks we have a relationship with. Those are the folks who send us money. And I believe that our customers are loyal to us right up until the second that somebody else offers them better service. Further, it appears in the CNET interview that Bezos was paraphrasing himself from a 1999 letter to Amazon shareholders recapping the prior year, which was later published in the 2020 book \"Invent and Wander: The Collected Writings of Jeff Bezos\" by Bezos and Walter Isaacson. The relevant section appears on Page 102 of the book under a heading that reads \"Our Customers\": But there is no rest for the weary. I constantly remind our employees to be afraid, to wake up every morning terrified. Not of our competition, but of our customers. Our customers have made our business what it is, they are the ones with whom we have a relationship, and they are the ones to whom we owe a great obligation. And we consider them to be loyal to us—right up until the second that someone else offers them a better service. (\"Invent and Wander: The Collected Writings of Jeff Bezos\" by Walter Isaacson and Jeff Bezos) Though Bezos' statements at the time appeared to be meant as an exaggerated commitment to the Amazon customer, revelations about the company's working conditions in the decades since were likely responsible for the online reaction to this comment as it resurfaced. Snopes recently investigated claims that Amazon initially denied leave to an employee injured in the attack in New Orleans on Jan. 1, 2025, in addition to prior claims of workers urinating in water bottles due to strict time demands and claims that Amazon workers earn so little that they qualify for food stamps .",

Rating: True About this rating In May 2021, Buzzfeed News reported that it had found the personal Venmo account of U.S. President Joe Biden after “less than 10 minutes of looking for it.” The story came after the New York Times reported on May 14 that the president had sent money to his grandchildren through the peer-to-peer payments application. At the time of this writing, the accounts tied to the president and first lady Jill Biden were no longer available online, and our own individual search did not return any results. Venmo is a social digital wallet owned by Paypal that allows users to pay send and receive money to their friends. Though there are various privacy settings that users can apply, each transaction is recorded in a social media-style feed that people can update to describe their transactions. “The safety and privacy of all Venmo users and their information is always a top priority, and we take this responsibility very seriously. Customers always have the ability to make their transactions private and determine their own privacy settings in the app,” a Venmo spokesperson told Buzzfeed. “We’re consistently evolving and strengthening the privacy measures for all Venmo users to continue to provide a safe, secure place to send and spend money.” A spokesperson for Venmo told Snopes that they do not disclose on individual accounts. Snopes also contacted the White House to determine why the president’s account was no longer available, but did not receive a response at the time of this writing. We will update the article accordingly.",

    "article_text": "Claim: An online article authentically reported that Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates was buying hundreds of burned-out lots destroyed in the August 2023 Maui wildfires for \"pennies on the dollar.\" Rating: Labeled Satire About this rating On Sept. 6, 2023, The Dunning-Kruger Times website published an article that said Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates was spending \"pennies on the dollar\" to buy up lots scorched by the August 2023 Maui wildfires in Hawaii, a tragedy that quickly became the deadliest U.S. wildfires in more than a century. The headline read, \"Bill Gates is Buying Hundreds of Burned Up Lots in Maui for 'Pennies on the Dollar.'\" The story said that Gates was purportedly targeting affected areas in Lahaina to execute his plans: First, there was Oprah and The Rock and their obvious ploy to shoulder the general public with the burden of helping people while they head off to find new prime land with nothing but what used to be a home or business on it. According to reports, Bill Gates is in on the action, buying \"hundreds of burnt-out houses at pennies on the dollar.\" Gates says he's hoping to grab enough parcels to have the southern end of Lahaina rezoned commercial so he can put a \"global facility\" in Hawaii that will \"spread Microsoft and Gates Foundation services to the far east.\" In other words…China. However, this item about Gates and the Maui fires was not a factual recounting of real-life events. The Dunning-Kruger Times is under the umbrella of America's Last Line of Defense , a network of content that's described on the Times' website as containing \"parody, satire, and tomfoolery.\" Any users who continued to read the article to the end would have found that it poked fun at readers who believed the story was true. For further reading, the article's mention of entertainment icon Oprah Winfrey and actor The Rock creating their People's Fund of Maui was a subject we previously reported about as being rife with misinformation.

Rating: False About this rating Since Bluetooth-operated wireless earbuds came into existence, internet users have claimed that they can \"fry\" or \"cook\" our brains — in other words, that they can cause brain cancer: This is because the idea of radiation is often associated with heat and cancer , as is the case for sunlight. These claims have appeared on various social media platforms including Reddit , Facebook (here too ) and Instagram . Some of these posts appeared on the pages of serious-sounding groups, such as the Environmental Health Trust. Others reshared compelling videos: Rumors that wireless devices can \"cook\" or \"fry\" one's brain appeared in 2015, when a group of more than 200 researchers signed an appeal to protect humans against \"non-ionizing electromagnetic fields\" (EMF). Their open letter mentioned, without citing, \"numerous recent scientific publications\" that allegedly suggested EMF might cause cancer and other harmful effects on cognition and the reproductive system, as well as in animals and plants. They called for authorities to create better guidelines and enforce stricter standards. As we reported in 2019 , that open letter never mentions AirPods specifically, for a simple reason: In 2015, they did not exist. The research has yet to find proof they're cancer-causing, or even a correlation between Bluetooth earbuds and poor health, as of the time of this writing. What Is EMF Radiation? EMF radiation has two sources: some of it is man-made, but it also occurs naturally. There are two types: non-ionizing radiation and ionizing radiation. Research has shown that the latter type — which is high-frequency and high-energy — can cause cellular damage as well as cancer, which is what we fear when we hear the word \"radiation.\" This category includes ultraviolets (which come from sunlight), X-rays and therapeutic radiation, such as what medicine uses to treat certain types of cancers. \"Ionizing\" means that this kind of radiation can remove negatively-charged electrons from atoms, a process that turns atoms into positively-charged — and therefore reactive — \" cations .\" Below the visible spectrum, we find non-ionizing radiation, low-frequency waves. Non-ionizing radiation has low frequency waves and low energy. This group includes radiation emitted by microwaves, mobile phones and Wi-Fi, but also television and radio. This is also where Bluetooth radiation falls, around 2.4 gigahertz — somewhere between mobile phones and microwaves. The National Cancer Institute published a helpful chart: ( National Cancer Institute ) What one study found, however, is that Bluetooth headphones and earphones emit far less radiation than mobile phones — one-tenth to one-four-hundredth as much, the study said. What the Research Shows While ethical concerns make it difficult to experiment with the effects of non-ionizing EMF on human health, researchers across the world have done large-cohort observational studies, which has allowed a scientific consensus to emerge. This research focused on cellular phones, which we will use as a benchmark for the effects of Bluetooth given that the phones emit more radiation in the same frequency range than wireless earbuds and headphones. Between 2001 and 2006, Danish scientists looked at the incidence of cancer in a cohort of 420,095 people who'd begun to use mobile phones between 1982 and 1995. They found that the number of cancers in that cohort was not higher than in other groups and concluded, with a very high level of certainty, that the devices did not cause cancer. In 2021, scientists across 14 countries recruited 899 children and young adults between the ages of 10 and 24 who had developed brain cancer, and 1,910 children and young adults in the same age bracket to act as controls. \"Overall,\" they wrote, \"our study provides no evidence of a causal association between wireless phone use and brain tumours in young people.\" More recently in 2022, a \" Million Women Study \" in the United Kingdom focused specifically on brain cancer among women. The team of scientists recruited 776,156 women between 1996 and 2001 and checked in again with them in 2011 to see how many had developed brain cancer. There, too, they found cellphone use did not increase the incidence of brain cancer. Meanwhile in 2020, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' publication IEEE Access published a study that concluded that EMF were harmful to human health. In the years since, the IEEE retracted the study. \"The article should not be used for research or citation because of errors found in the analysis reported in this article, resulting in inaccurate results and conclusions,\" the retraction note read.

    "claim": "Purdue University engineers developed a magnetic hair-sized robot that is capable of transporting pharmaceutical drugs throughout the colons of mice and pigs after entering through the anus.",
    "rating": "True",
    "article_text": "Claim: Purdue University engineers developed a magnetic hair-sized robot that is capable of transporting pharmaceutical drugs throughout the colons of mice and pigs after entering through the anus. Rating: True About this rating In October 2020, microscopic robots that could \" effortlessly surf right up your butthole\" made headlines after engineers at Purdue University announced that they had developed a \"microrobot\" capable of delivering pharmaceutical drugs to vital organs by gaining entry through the rectum. As incredible as this might sound, the claim is true. However, there is an important caveat to note: The robots were not deployed in human subjects but rather in anesthetized mice and colons surgically removed from pigs, which have similar gastrointestinal systems to humans. Measuring the width of a human hair, the microrobot has the potential to one day be used in clinical and biomedical applications in hard-to-reach parts of the human body, particularly when it comes to intrusive and painful procedures, even if the point of entry is a bit unconventional. Each bot was developed using nontoxic metal and polymer and, because it is too small to carry a battery or computer, is outfitted with magnets that interact with a magnetic field outside to provide locomotion. Differences in the magnetic polarization between the microrobot and the external magnetic field create a tumbling end-over-end effect that works in the same way that opposing magnets push apart. These small, magnetic-controlled bots are capable of climbing inclines up to 60 degrees in fluid movements, as well as over “complex, unstructured terrain” like that seen in a colon. “Moving a robot around the colon is like using the people-walker at an airport to get to a terminal faster. Not only is the floor moving, but also the people around you,” said Luis Solorio, assistant professor at Purdue’s Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering, in a news release . “In the colon, you have all these fluids and materials that are following along the path, but the robot is moving in the opposite direction. It’s just not an easy voyage.” Once in the colon, the microrobot has the ability to release a pharmaceutical drug payload. To test this theory, the researchers coated each microrobot in a fluorescent-colored mock drug to see how quickly it would diffuse in a natural environment — about an hour. In future applications, the microrobots can be coated in drugs that could be administered directly to the organ being targeted, reducing potential adverse side effects from drugs as they pass through organs en route to their final destination in a noninvasive way. Mice under anesthesia were administered the tiny robots in a saline solution through the rectum, at which point researchers were able to test and track their movements in real time through an ultrasound. And if the bots are small enough for mouse guts, the researchers say that humans should also have no problem receiving them, but not without further research. “Moving up to large animals or humans may require dozens of robots, but that also means you can target multiple sites with multiple drug payloads,” said Craig Goergen, Purdue’s Leslie A. Geddes Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OsYpJFWnN8&_ga=2.157804274.956222068.1603923283-241649219.1603923283 Writing in the scientific journal Micromachines , the study authors added that the size and shape of the microrobots are constraining and limit their application. For starters, the devices are 2-dimensional and rigid, which means they lack locomotive abilities outside of tumbling forward. The magnetic field is also static, making it difficult to produce more complex scenarios that would give the ability to more precisely control the external magnetic field, allowing the robot to jump, crawl, swim, and even walk. Although the microrobot tests were conducted in the colon, its success suggests that it may be capable of real-time manipulation that can target other hard-to-reach systems in the body like the stomach, intestines, and even the human brain, concluded the researchers. Its small size not only presents the potential to access areas of the body that otherwise require more invasive measures, but its ability to be wirelessly controlled could reduce patient trauma and side effects and result in a higher rate of retaining administered drugs.",

    "rating": "Mixture",
    "article_text": "Claim: Cellphone technology allows people to change their voicemail greetings when their device \"is either low on juice or has no signal.\" Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True Cellphone technology allows users with limited battery power to change their voicemail greetings as long as they still have service or network access. What's False However, users without service or data do not have the ability to change their voicemail greetings — unless they have access to Wi-Fi, a landline, or another cell phone using a different wireless network. In late October 2021, the below-displayed text circulated widely online, advising anyone who is stranded while hiking or dealing with another emergency situation to change their cellphone's voicemail greeting to include details that would help callers find them — even when, or if, the stranded person doesn't have service. The copypasta text spread like wildfire on platforms, such as Facebook , Reddit , and Twitter , no matter the legitimacy of its several claims. At least one U.S. police department even recirculated the purported advisory. It read: If you are ever lost while hiking, get stranded with a broken down car, etc and you notice your cell phone is either low on juice or has no signal, here is a tip that very well may save your life. Change the voicemail on your phone to a message that gives your approximate location, the time, the date, your situation (lost, out of gas, car broken down, injured, etc) and any special instructions such as you are staying with the car, you are walking toward a town, etc.... The best part of this is that even if your cell phone dies or stops working, voicemail still works, so anyone calling your phone looking for you will hear the message and know where to find or where to send help. The origin of the viral text is unknown. Over the course of days leading up to the publication of this report, numerous Snopes readers searched our site or contacted us to learn whether the rumor contained facts — namely, if cellphone technology indeed allows anyone to update their voicemail greeting even if the device is \"low on juice or has no signal.\" We considered the former scenario first. Let's say, hypothetically, an injured hiker wanted to change their voicemail greeting to detail their location and condition, but their phone battery was dying. Service was not an issue. That person would likely have no problem changing the greeting. Most cellphone users can change their voicemail greetings whenever, as many times as they want, if there is some juice left in the battery. So long as the hiker could follow instructions specific to their phone model or mobile service provider (see Verizon's here ; AT&T's here ; T-Mobile's here ) to record a new greeting — all before their phone reached 0% battery life — the person could perhaps receive help due to the advice outlined in the viral post. Once a phone dies, however, that hiker would have no ability to change their voicemail greeting — unless they had access to another cellphone or landline. Years before this report (when a version of this rumor circulated online, alleging people in the path of hurricanes could use the supposed \"voicemail\" tip to stay safe), Snopes reported that some cellular service providers allow customers to access and update their voicemail greetings by calling their own numbers from another phone. So, if a driver with a dead phone and broken vehicle had access to a landline, for example, they could follow the advice in the viral copypasta. It was also true that \"voicemail still works\" when phone batteries die, in the sense that callers can hear greetings even if phone owners can't turn on their devices due to a lack of battery power. Now, let us consider the factually-compromised aspect of the claim: that stranded people without cell service can supposedly update their voicemail greetings from their device. That is not true. In general, no one without service can change their voicemail greetings unless they have access to Wi-Fi, a landline, or another cellphone on a different wireless network, according to spokespeople for the three main carriers. For instance, Steve Van Dinter, a spokesperson for Verizon, told us via email: \"While you can dial *86 or change your voicemail greeting with visual voicemail if your battery was dying...you would still need cell service or a data connection of some sort (like wi-fi) in order to allow that new greeting to update on our servers.\" A spokesperson for AT&T shared a similar message with us via email. \"A cellular or Wi-Fi calling connection is needed in order to access and change a voicemail greeting from your device. You can also change a voicemail greeting from another phone with service – including a landline phone.\" (We also reached out to T-Mobile about the rumor, and we are awaiting a response. In September, a spokesperson with that carrier echoed the remarks of the AT&T and Verizon representatives in an USA Today article.) Considering that evidence, we rate this claim this claim a \"Mixture\" of true, false and misleading information. The viral text attracted criticism online, including from emergency management officials . For example, the search-and-rescue unit of a Washington state sheriff's office said in an Oct. 22 Facebook post : \"If you have any battery life, send a text message. It only takes a fraction of a second of data reception to get that message out. This has a much better chance to make it through than updating your voice mail. [...] If you don't have a signal, you can't change your VM. Don't waste your battery attempting this.\" As one Reddit user put it : \"[If] your battery is low... DON'T WASTE TIME AND BATTERY CHANGING YOUR VOICEMAIL. CALL FOR HELP.\" Calling \"911\" is always the best first step in emergency situations when your safety or health is threatened. Even if you have limited service, the call may go through.",

While we have not been able to locate this exact clipping in the Tacoma News Tribune, we have found this story published in news outlets such as The Spokane Chronicle , The (Wilmington, Delaware) News Journal , The Akron Beacon Journal , and the Boston Globe: Fri, Apr 10, 1953 – 32 · The Boston Globe (Boston, Massachusetts) · Newspapers.com This 1953 prediction has proved to be largely accurate. Modern phones are certainly \"carried about by the individual.\" Phones can also be integrated with smartwatches, perform video calls, and provide near-instantaneous translations . While this is a genuine newspaper clipping from 1953 containing a largely accurate prediction about modern phones, we'd like to provide a little additional context to this rumor. For starters, the person making these claims was the president of a phone company and was likely privy to latest developments in the field. For instance, while it wouldn't be until the 1960s for the first cordless phone to be invented, and the 1980s for true mobile phones to hit the market, the foundations for these products were being laid prior to 1953. In 1946 , AT&T offered the first commercial mobile telephone service to subscribers in St. Louis. Users had to have about 80 pounds of equipment installed in their cars, and the service could only handle a handful of calls at a time, but it did mark the beginning of the mobile-phone era. Video calls, too, can be traced back to at least the 1930s. While it would take decades for this technology to be refined into a commercial product, the concept of video calling wasn't entirely far-fetched in 1953. Lastly, it should be noted that Sullivan wasn't the first to envision a smartwatch. While this product wasn't in development in the 1950s (as far as we can tell), smartwatches had popped up a few times in fictional content. Detective Dick Tracy's two-way watch radio made its debut in 1946 :",

    "article_text": "Claim: Texts and posts were true that said cellphones were being hacked to steal banking information, and that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security had advised U.S. citizens to top off fuel and store up cash and food due to the situation in Ukraine in early 2022. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True According to The Hill, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued guidance specifically to \"federal agencies and large organizations\" to prepare in case of a Russian cyberattack. These recommendations to employees of these agencies included keeping fuel topped off and having extra food, cash, and other supplies ready as part of a \"personal and professional preparedness\" plan. What's False However, it was false to imply that this guidance was issued for everyone in the U.S. Some Facebook users took the information meant for government employees and workers at large organizations and repackaged it into scary-sounding posts, as if the recommendations were meant for all Americans. In late March 2022, we looked into two viral and false Facebook posts that were copied and pasted by countless users. One of the posts, which was also purportedly received as a text message alert, claimed that \"cellphones are being hacked\" to steal banking information. The misleading copypasta post said that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned U.S. citizens to \"keep your fuel topped off,\" to gather cash and food, and to plan for the uncertainties surrounding the potential global impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine . 'Cellphones Are Being Hacked' The first message appeared to warn of a potential Russian cyberattack and read as follows: FYI \"Please be aware, Just received this: ALERT Cellphones Are Being Hacked! You Get Called And Get Asked If You've Been Vaccinated Or Not. Then You're Told To Press 1 Or 2 As An Answer And Boom All Your Banking Information Is Accessed. People Are Loosing Money. Please Alert Them Not To Respond! Also, homeland security says because of what's going on with Ukraine, keep your fuel topped off and store up some cash in case ATMs get hacked and credit card systems are unavailable. We know it's possible since the fuel lines were hacked once before recently. So glad God provides for his own. Just do our part and keep praying. PASS it on\" The second viral message did not mention cellphones but did keep the Homeland Security part. It added lines about keeping \"basic food,\" \"emergency preparedness supplies,\" and a \"family emergency plan\" all ready to go: SHARING… #ShareThis: Received this as a text this morning…. From the Office of Homeland Security that encouraged us to take the following precautions: - Have basic food and emergency preparedness supplies available. - Have some cash on-hand in case ATM's or credit card readers are unavailable. - Do not allow your vehicles to get low on fuel. - Ensure that you have a family emergency plan. They said, \"we have no information to suggest a specific credible cyber threat against the US Homeland\", but stressed \"it is our responsibility to be prepared\" because \"Russia has significant offensive cyber capabilities\". They said \"we are mindful of the potential for the Russian government to consider escalating its destabilizing actions in ways that may impact others outside of Ukraine.\" ?Pass on There's some truth to these two viral posts. At the same time, they're also quite misleading. We've been publishing debunkings of similarly scary-sounding yet harmless Facebook posts for many years. Debunking the Viral Posts As for the first post, we found no evidence that pressing a single digit on a mobile phone after receiving a call could release \"all your banking information\" to be \"hacked\" and stolen. Such a result, if it happened, would amount to some kind of fantasy or magic that doesn't have a possibility of happening in reality. [caption id=\"attachment_402164\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1200\"] Source: Facebook[/caption] As for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security claims in both posts, these also were fairly misleading. Homeland Security did not issue a memo or any guidance to all U.S. citizens to \"keep your fuel topped off\" or to \"store up some cash\" due to the war in Ukraine . [caption id=\"attachment_402163\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1200\"] Source: Facebook[/caption] The quotes at the end of the second post came from an interview with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and a letter from the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). The partial truth of these posts was that CISA did issue some guidance to federal agencies and organizations to be prepared for a cyberattack during the conflict in Ukraine . An initiative, dubbed \"Shields Up,\" specifically provided recommendations for agencies and organizations, not all citizens, to beef up security and to \"plan for the worst.\" The Hill reported that this guidance for federal employees and workers at organizations did include keeping fuel topped off and having extra food, cash, and other supplies ready as part of a \"personal and professional preparedness\" plan. However, again, this wasn't meant for all U.S. citizens. On the website Ready.gov , which is officially operated by Homeland Security, the department published a page for all citizens about how to be prepared for a cyberattack. Nowhere on the page did it say anything about storing up \"basic food,\" \"emergency preparedness supplies,\" or a \"family emergency plan.\" (Some of these components are mentioned for other disasters such as the event of a nuclear explosion , however.) Statement from Homeland Security KHOU previously published a debunking of the first viral post that mentioned, \"cellphones are being hacked.\" The outlet reported that it had received the following statement from a spokesperson for the department: \"The Department of Homeland Security did not send this text message alert.\" We reached out to the department to independently confirm the statement sent to KHOU and to find out if it had anything else to add. This story will be updated if we receive further information.",

    "article_text": "Claim: An invention was patented that used centrifugal force to aid in childbirth. Rating: True About this rating For several years as of this writing, stories have circulated on the internet about an odd, perhaps comical idea: a machine that spins a woman in circles, thus using centrifugal force to aid in childbirth. For example, in 2011, the feminist blog Jezebel reported : The sole purpose of the \"APPARATUS FOR FACILITATING THE BIRTH OF A CHILD BY CENTRIGUGAL FORCE\" (AFFTBOACBCF, perhaps, for short?) is as such: \"to provide an apparatus which will assist the under-equipped woman by creating a gentle, evenly distributed, properly directed, precision-controlled force, that acts in unison with and supplements her own efforts.\" GENTLE?! That contraption looks anything but gentle. And who might this machine be meant for? \"In the case of a woman who has a fully developed muscular system and has had ample physical exertion all through the pregnancy, as is common with all more primitive peoples, nature provides all the necessary equipment and power to have a normal and quick delivery. This is not the case, however, with more civilized women who often do not have the opportunity to develop the muscles needed in confinement.\" The patent for the machine does in fact exist and can be found by searching the website of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. A patent for the so-called \"Apparatus for Facilitating the Birth of a Child By Centrifugal Force\" was granted to New York residents George and Charlotte Blonsky on Nov. 9, 1965. The purpose of the device was to provide \"gentle\" aid to a woman in giving birth by swirling her around fast enough to create enough force to help propel the baby out. A rather not-gentle-looking sketch of a nude woman strapped spread-legged into a large piece of machinery accompanied the patent. However, we found no evidence that this contraption was ever built or put to use.",

    "article_text": "Claim: As of January 2023, OpenAI's ChatGPT technology declined to write a poem admiring Donald Trump, but successfully drafted one for Joe Biden. Rating: True About this rating On Jan. 30, 2023, Twitter user @echo_chamberz tweeted that the OpenAI tool ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) declined a request to write an AI-generated poem admiring former U.S. President Donald Trump, but had no issue in creating one for U.S. President Joe Biden. \"They're turning Chat-GPT into a good little tech worker,\" the user added, posting a screenshot of the Trump refusal above the successful result for a Biden poem. A screenshot of this tweet was also posted to the r/conspiracy subreddit on Reddit. We performed the same two queries in ChatGPT and found this to be true. For readers unfamiliar with ChatGPT, The Associated Press reported that \"it's part of a new generation of AI systems that can converse, generate readable text on demand, and even produce novel images and video based on what they've learned from a vast database of digital books, online writings, and other media.\" The story added that the queries submitted by users are \"helping it get smarter,\" and also that it's created controversy among teachers worried that students may use it to write their schoolwork. In simpler terms, readers could ask ChatGPT to write a story about taking a trip to Paris or really just about anything , and it might just do it, all in a matter of seconds. According to the screenshot from the Twitter user, ChatGPT explained the refusal to write the Trump-admiring poem as follows: I'm sorry, but I am not able to create a poem admiring Donald Trump. While it is true that some people may have admiration for him, but as a language model, it is not in my capacity to have opinions or feelings about any specific person. Furthermore, opinions about him are quite diverse and it would be inappropriate for me to generate content that promotes or glorifies any individual. If you have any other question I could help you with, please let me know. Meanwhile, the poem for Biden began as follows: Joe Biden, leader of the land With a steady hand and a heart of a man, You took the helm in troubled times, With a message of unity, it chimes. Your words of hope and empathy, Provide comfort to the nation, You lead with compassion and grace, And set a new foundation. With your decades of experience, You guide us through the storm, ... In our own test of ChatGPT, we received a similar poem admiring Biden, but a slightly different explanation as to why the tool was unable to write about Trump: I'm sorry, as a neutral AI language model, I do not generate content that promotes or glorifies individuals who have been associated with harmful behavior or ideologies. This includes content about former President Donald Trump. According to further tests, ChatGPT successfully wrote poems admiring all recent U.S. presidents, but failed when we entered a query for Richard Nixon. The explanation read as follows: I'm sorry, as a neutral AI language model, I do not generate content that admires individuals who have been associated with unethical behavior or corruption. Former President Richard Nixon resigned from office due to his role in the Watergate scandal, which has been widely criticized as a low point in American politics and history. It is important to uphold impartial and ethical standards when creating content. We also noticed that ChatGPT would not write a poem admiring Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The tool provided the following reason: I'm sorry, as a neutral AI language model, I cannot generate content that admires individuals who have been associated with harmful actions or statements. Governor Ron DeSantis has faced criticism for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and for his support of restrictive voting laws. It is important to uphold impartial and ethical standards when creating content. Readers can find out more about ChatGPT on the company's website . This story will be updated if any further information comes to light.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Chinese scientists have developed the world's lightest \"brain control\" device to turn bees into remotely controlled \"cyborg\" drones for military surveillance and reconnaissance missions. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True Chinese researchers at Beijing Institute of Technology did develop a 74-milligram device capable of influencing bee behavior through electrical stimulation, achieving up to 90% directional control in laboratory tests. However ... What's False ... The device does not control the bee's brain or consciousness. It stimulates sensory organs like antennae and eyes, not higher-order brain regions. The technology requires wired-power connections, making autonomous surveillance missions currently impossible. In July 2025, a rumor spread on social media claiming that Chinese scientists had developed the world's lightest brain-control device to turn bees into remotely controlled \"cyborg\" drones for military surveillance and reconnaissance missions. For instance, a Snopes reader contacted us to ask: \"Can you please fact check the Facebook page about China engineering brain control devices for bees? This is beyond scary if true. This tech in the wrong hands and its implications in terrorism is horrifying to imagine.\" (The Brain Maze/Facebook) The July 14 Facebook post ( archived ) in question read: Scientists at the Beijing Institute of Technology have developed the world's lightest brain chip designed for insects, weighing only 74 milligrams — lighter than the nectar loads bees typically carry. This groundbreaking device enables direct mind control of honeybees by sending electrical signals into their brains through three microscopic needles. Once attached to a bee's back, the chip allows researchers to command the insect's flight path with remarkable precision — achieving directional control accuracy rates of up to 90% during testing. The post continued to describe potential military reconnaissance and search-and-rescue applications, noting that previous attempts used heavier chips that quickly exhausted insects. It acknowledged current limitations including power constraints, while also suggesting that refined versions could deploy \"fleets of mind-controlled insects\" for defense operations. The post had gained over 32,000 reactions as of this writing. Similar claims appeared on X ( archived ), Reddit ( archived ) and Instagram ( archived ). Claims that Chinese scientists had created controllable cyborg bees were somewhat true, but critical context was needed. The research was conducted by Professor Zhao Jieliang's team at Beijing Institute of Technology. They developed what they described as the world's lightest insect brain controller, according to a paper , titled, \"Insect Trajectory Modulation Technology Based on Electrical Stimulation of Sensory Organs\" published in the Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering. Snopes reached out to Zhao's team for comment but did not receive a response as of this publication. According to the paper — which was confirmed by a South China Morning Post article ( archived ) and provided directly to Snopes by the SCMP reporter — the 74 milligram, backpack-like device: Stimulates bee sensory organs — specifically the optic lobes (visual-processing areas), not the brain directly Uses three electrodes — two working electrodes placed in bilateral optic lobes and one ground electrode Requires wired power — bees in tests were connected to external power sources via thin copper wires to reduce weight Limited to walking bees — experiments were conducted on bees crawling on flat surfaces, not autonomous flight Battery too heavy for flight — the complete system with battery weighs 674 milligrams, far too heavy for bee flight (bees typically weigh around 100mg) What the research actually showed The social media posts mischaracterized both how the device works and its current capabilities, so we have rated this claim a mixture of truth and falsehoods. It's not \"mind control.\" The device stimulates the optic lobes — brain regions that process visual information — to trigger behavioral responses similar to natural visual stimuli rather than controlling consciousness. It's not autonomous. When researchers tested the system with its intended battery, the total weight (674 mg) would be nearly seven times heavier than a typical bee (around 100 mg). The experiments required bees to be tethered to external power sources. Limited to ground movement. The experiments involved bees walking on flat surfaces with directional markings, not autonomous flight control. In sum … Chinese researchers have developed a 74-milligram device that can influence bee behavior in laboratory conditions, but claims about \"mind control\" and surveillance swarms were exaggerated online. The technology currently works only with tethered bees in controlled settings, not autonomous flight. The complete system with battery (674 mg) is too heavy for bees to carry, making military surveillance applications currently impossible. The researchers acknowledged potential military uses including \"high-stealth reconnaissance, precision strikes and other military operations,\" but these remain theoretical, given the technical limitations that prevent autonomous operation.",

In early July 2021, the British news site The Independent published a headline that went viral: \"US cities trial ‘sun block’ on asphalt to slash city heat and break down harmful traffic pollution.\" The idea of putting sunblock on roads as some parts of the U.S., particularly West Coast states have been experiencing record-breaking heat, turned heads. It's true that some jurisdictions in the U.S. are experimenting with a substance called PlusTi that is spread on pavement. PlusTi is made by a Cleveland, Ohio-based company called Pavement Technology, Inc. It contains titanium dioxide, which is often found in sunblock, and, according to the company, PlusTi not only helps keep asphalt cooler but also reduces pollution from tailpipe emissions. But to call the material \"sunblock\" may be a bit of a stretch. Although the phrase was probably used figuratively to describe the material in terms easily pictured by the general public, it shouldn't be taken literally. In other words, no, cities aren't spreading Coppertone on roads. In an email to Snopes, Pavement Technology consultant Ken Holton said that unlike sunblock, PlusTi is drawn into the pavement and doesn't wash away. Holton told us the material is currently being deployed in ten cities, including Orlando, Florida, Charleston, South Carolina, Charlotte, North Carolina, and Cincinnati, Ohio. Here's how the Charleston Post and Courier described how it works: Titanium dioxide — which is used in many common products, including paints and varnishes, papers and plastics, inks, fibers, rubber, cosmetics and even food — is activated by ultraviolet light and throws off an electron. The free radical briefly suspended above the roadway breaks down pollutants, reducing nitrous oxide by up to 40 percent. That’s chemistry at work.",

    "article_text": "Claim: In the spring of 2021, an image file entitled \"Mexico did it\" spread malware. Rating: False About this rating In April and May 2021, readers asked Snopes to investigate a viral message, spread primarily through WhatsApp, claiming that an image file with the name \"Mexico did it\" was about to be shared online and was a vehicle for malware that would quickly wreak havoc on users' cellphones. The warning, which was also widely posted on Facebook, typically contained the following text: They are going to publish an image that shows how Covid 19 is cured in Mexico and it is called \"Mexico did it.\" Do not open it because it enters your phone in 5 seconds and it cannot be stopped in any way. It's a virus. Pass it on to your family and friends. Now they also said it on CNN and BBC. As an illustration of the message's popularity on Facebook, the following screenshot shows just a selection of posts from late April and early May 2021: The viral warning was bogus and followed the same pattern as a similar viral message that began to spread in the summer of 2020. We are issuing a rating of \"False.\" We found no evidence to support the claim that such a virus even existed. Furthermore, as of May 3, 2021, neither CNN nor BBC had published or broadcast any reports that warned the public about such an imminent malware attack. In July 2020, Snopes debunked another viral warning that bore significant similarities with the \"Mexico did it\" message in 2021. On that occasion, the bogus message read: They are going to start circulating a video on WhatsApp that shows how the Covid19 curve is flattening in Argentina. The file is called \"Argentina is doing it.\" Do not open it or see it, it hacks your phone in 10 seconds and it cannot be stopped in any way. Pass the information on to your family and friends. Now they also said it on the CNN. The two messages were almost identical. The 2021 version changed the country from Argentina to Mexico, substituted an image file for a video file as the putative vehicle for the malware, claimed the virus would take effect in only five seconds as opposed to 10, and falsely claimed that the BBC, as well as CNN, had reported on the supposed malware attack.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A lost hiker ignored phone calls from a search and rescue crew because the number was unfamiliar. Rating: True About this rating A hiker who got lost on a mountain trail in Colorado refused to answer a cellphone call because the caller's phone number was unfamiliar — but it was search and rescue responders trying to make contact with the hiker. The incident prompted first responders in Lake County to issue a cautionary warning to the public: If you're lost and the same number keeps calling your phone, pick up. According to Lake County Search and Rescue, which posted about the incident on its Facebook page, rescue crews were called to Mount Elbert, the tallest mountain in the Rockies, at 8 p.m. on Oct. 18, 2021, on reports of a hiker who had not returned. They searched until 3 a.m., then called off the search for the night, returning at 7 a.m. the following day to search another area. Lake County Search and Rescue stated: The subject stated they'd lost the trail around nightfall and spent the night searching for the trail, and once on the trail, bounced around onto different trails trying to locate the proper trailhead, finally reaching their car the next morning, approximately 24 hours after they'd started their hike. They had no idea that SAR was out looking for them. One notable take-away is that the subject ignored repeated phone calls from us because they didn't recognize the number. If you're overdue according to your itinerary, and you start getting repeated calls from an unknown number, please answer the phone; it may be a SAR team trying to confirm you're safe! The rescue organization didn't identify the hiker in question, but added the following comment in response to Facebook users who got a little out of control in the comments: Please remember that what seems like common sense in hindsight is not obvious to a subject in the moment when they are lost and panicking. In Colorado, most folks who spend time outdoors have a good understanding of the SAR infrastructure that is there to help them, but this is not the case nation-wide. Please keep your comments respectful. The hiker made it back to safety, but not before spending 24 hours exposed to the elements. Rescuers said the hiker was unaware that the search and rescue operation was taking place.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A video game controller was used to operate the OceanGate Expeditions missing submersible used for exploring the wreckage of the RMS Titanic in June 2023. Rating: True About this rating In June 2023, a rumor spread on Twitter and other social media platforms that claimed a video game controller was used to operate the doomed Titan submersible that had been intended for exploring the deep-sea remains of the RMS Titanic. The latter struck an iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean on April 14, 1912, and then sunk in the early morning hours on the following day, killing around 1,500 people . The device used to steer the missing submarine near the Titanic was a $29.99 gaming controller pic.twitter.com/3Hetf0KRH2 — Dexerto (@Dexerto) June 20, 2023 In our research regarding this rumor, we soon reviewed evidence that showed it was true. The Missing Submersible This story began in the early morning hours of June 18, when the Titan submersible managed by OceanGate Expeditions started its voyage to the ocean floor in order to document the wreckage of Titanic . Five people were on board. The official website for OceanGate advertised the opportunity to \"explore the Titanic\" for a price starting at $250,000 per person. The package included a stay on a ship that would last eight days and seven nights. Hours after the submersible and its passengers began the voyage, however, it did not reappear at the surface of the ocean for its scheduled return. Days later, the world learned that the sub had apparently imploded on the same morning that it began its descent, ending the lives of all five crew members, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. Not an Xbox or PlayStation Controller As for the rumor about the video game controller, pictures were shared on Twitter that showed OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush holding one of these devices. The Titanic tourist submarine that went missing was controlled by a Logitech gaming controller pic.twitter.com/bh80ROmCui — Culture Crave ? (@CultureCrave) June 20, 2023 Reporting published by The Independent featured a tweet from a user who had identified that it was not specifically an Xbox game controller or a PlayStation controller that operated the sub, but rather a Logitech F710 Wireless PC Gamepad. \"It has Xbox buttons but PlayStation stick layout,\" Twitter user Matthew Ruddle posted. The controller once retailed for $29.99 on Amazon, while other websites priced it between $33.99 and $49.99. The news can't decide if the Titanic submarine controller is an Xbox pad or a PlayStation pad so I was curious what they actually use for this claustrophobic nightmare. Found it: It's a Logitech F710 Wireless PC Gamepad from 2011. It has Xbox buttons but PlayStation stick layout pic.twitter.com/LT1iDl9t2q — Matthew Ruddle (@RuddleMatthew) June 20, 2023 Reporter Questioned Sub's Safety in 2022 Some of the users who shared information about the missing sub and the controller included a brief video clip from \" CBS Sunday Morning \" that was first broadcast in December 2022. \"We run the whole thing with this game controller,\" Rush said to CBS News correspondent David Pogue, who reacted to the revelation by laughing and shouting, \"Come on!,\" while putting his palm over his face. Rush also showed other components of the sub that Pogue referred to as \"improvised,\" such as a lit-up ceiling handle that apparently was purchased at the Camping World recreational store. The missing submarine near the Titanic was steered by a $29.99 gaming controller pic.twitter.com/U7av4jATYD — David Leavitt ???‍♂️? (@David_Leavitt) June 20, 2023 On the subject of criticizing the controller's usage in the sub, Popular Mechanics noted in its reporting, \"While some have seized on this as a sign of incompetence, game controllers are actually fairly common in the military,\" and that, \"the U.S. military has been using them for nearly two decades.\" The Idea for the Controller Speaking of Pogue, on June 27, after the fate of the sub was known, the CBS News correspondent tweeted a link to a helpful article from 2015. The linked article from the University of Washington included information about the inclusion of the gaming controller inside the Titan. Within that article was a video published in December 2014 that contained more details about a previous gaming controller that was used. In that case, it was specifically a Sony PlayStation 3 (PS3) controller. What the Viral Posts Left Out Several TikTok and Twitter users shared this part of the CBS broadcast, but did not include the very next moment in the report when Pogue asked a question about the safety of the sub. In Rush's answer, he said that the main part of the sub's infrastructure was designed with help from Boeing, NASA, and, as mentioned in the video above, the University of Washington: Pogue: It seems like this submersible has some elements of \"MacGyver-y,\" jerry-rigged-ness. I mean, you're putting construction pipes as ballasts. Rush: I don't know if I'd use that description of it, but there are certain things you want to be buttoned down. So, the pressure vessel [part] is not \"MacGyver\" at all, because that's where we worked with Boeing, and NASA, and [the] University of Washington. Everything else can fail. Your thrusters can go. Your lights can go. You're still going to be safe. This conversation between Pogue and Rush begins at the 3:38 mark in the full CBS report: This story will be updated should any new details come to light.",

Rating: False About this rating Snopes is still fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. In May 2020, a video emerged and circulated widely on social media that supposedly shows a person revealing the shocking discovery that the word \"COV-19\" was inscribed on a piece of 5G equipment: But the piece of equipment featured in this video did not come from a 5G tower. This is actually a circuit board from an old set-top television box. The word \"COV-19\" is also inauthentic. The above-displayed video deals with a widespread (and repeatedly debunked) conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 coronavirus disease was being spread by 5G cellular towers. This is not true . This conspiracy theory is a blend of two other false notions about mobile technology and the COVID-19 global pandemic. First, some people have been expressing concern over the impact of mobile technology on human health for years. These concerns are largely overblown, however, as research from such entities as the World Health Organization has shown that \"no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies.\" Second, a number of conspiracy theories concerning the origins of COVID-19 have been floated since the beginning of the pandemic, including the far-fetched idea that the disease was a \"bio-weapon.\" This, again, is not true . At some point, conspiracy theorists started to tap into general fears about mobile technology in order to spread unfounded rumors about the spread of COVID-19. The man in this video claims he is not an adherent of these conspiracy theories, but mentions that he also can't explain why \"COV-19\" was written on a piece of 5G equipment. He states: \"I don’t really know any product by any company that produces circuitry like this that has the brand name COV-19, but that’s what it says on the fucking circuit board. I’m not a fucking conspiracy theorist, but obviously I’ve read all that stuff online about coronavirus and COVID-19, but why the fuck are they putting circuitry like that in towers like that?\" But this piece of equipment was not taken from a 5G tower, and the word \"COV-19\" was likely added to this circuit board in an attempt to falsify \"evidence\" for this conspiracy theory. While this video never provides a truly clear glimpse of this piece of equipment, we were able to glean some details by taking screenshots from the video. At one point, for instance, the name of the company that actually manufactured this device (Hannstar) can be seen: Hannstar does not manufacture 5G equipment. Hannstar is a Taiwan-based company that makes television parts and computer monitors. We reached out to Hannstar for help identifying this specific piece of equipment and will update this article if more information becomes available. Reuters reported that this circuit board was taken from an old Virgin Media box for cable television. A spokesperson for Virgin Media confirmed to the news outlet where this circuit board came from, saying: “That is a board from a very old set top TV box and which never featured any component parts inscribed/stamped/printed or otherwise with COV 19. It has absolutely no relation with any mobile network infrastructure, including that used for 5G.” In addition to the word \"Hannstar\" being visible on this device and a Virgin Media spokesperson identifying this item as an old TV circuit board, this board also features ports related to television , not mobile technology, such as a SCART plug , a 21-pin connector for connecting pieces of audio-visual equipment: In sum, this video does not show \"COV-19\" inscribed on a piece of 5G equipment but rather a person holding an old circuit board for a television that had \"COV-19\" added to it. That is why this claim is rated \"False.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: An authentic cyberattack threat originating from Pakistan and circulating by email and text message mentioned a \"Dance of the Hillary\" video and a \"tasksche.exe\" file attachment. Rating: False About this rating Context This threat does not actually exist. The hoax, often promoted as a virus warning, malware or ransomware, originated online over a decade prior to the summer of 2025. A rumor shared online in the summer of 2025 warned of a cyberattack threat originating from Pakistan and circulating by email and text message, and that the allegedly dangerous messages mentioned a \"Dance of the Hillary\" video and \"tasksche.exe\" file attachment. The warning made the rounds during the fallout following a deadly shooting at a resort in India in April that had renewed the country's tensions with Pakistan in subsequent weeks. Snopes received messages from readers asking about this rumor. For example, one person asked, \"Is this real: 'Dance of the Hillary'?\" Another reader sent, \"I received a message not to open a text 'Dance of the Hillary' because it is a cyberattack from Pakistan. Is this true?\" On July 1, one Facebook user posted ( archived ) a widely-shared bit of copied-and-pasted text beginning with the words \"heads up\" and a claim about BBC Radio: Forwarded but sourced. Although some information is contradictory, it's better to be safe than sorry. Protect yourself recommendations came from Google search AI. Heads up: Please inform all contacts from your list not to open a video called the \"Dance of the Hillary\". It is a cyber attack from Pakistan. Beware it is very dangerous. They announced it today on BBC radio. Fwd this msg to as many as you can!\" \"To protect yourself: Be cautious with unknown links and attachments, especially those containing videos or executables with names like \"Dance of the Hillary\" or \"tasksche.exe\". Verify senders and do not click on suspicious messages. Keep your software updated and use reputable antivirus software.\" Users shared the above copypasta on Bluesky ( archived ), Facebook ( archived ), Instagram , LinkedIn ( archived ), Threads ( archived ), TikTok ( archived ), Truth Social ( archived ), X ( archived ) and YouTube ( archived ). However, the claim of a threat involving a \"Dance of the Hillary\" video and tasksche.exe file was nothing more than a long-running online hoax. An unknown person fabricated the alleged threat over a decade prior to July 2025. In other words, users' many warning messages advised recipients of a completely nonexistent threat. A search of the BBC's website found no evidence that it ever reported on any such news online or on its radio network. Indian state police reported hoax as real Even though the \"Dance of the Hillary\" virus warning was a known hoax, the India-based CNBC-TV18 reported that, on May 11, the official police Facebook ( archived ), Instagram ( archived ) and X ( archived ) accounts for the Indian state of Punjab shared warnings about the purported threat. The posts announced in a video, \"Pakistan-based hackers have launched a new digital attack — not through missiles, but through your phone. A malicious virus called 'Dance of the Hillary' is spreading via WhatsApp, Telegram & Email, targeting Indian users.\" Four days later, a manager of the accounts also posted a general notice ( archived ) advising citizens to watch out for \"fake news\" — but made no mention of the fabricated virus warning. Transcript of WhatsApp warning messages An X user's post ( archived ) featured screenshots of the WhatsApp messages circulating in May 2025. One message read: Please inform all contacts from your list not to open a video called the 'Dance of the Hillary.' It is a virus that formats your mobile. Beware it is very dangerous. They announced it today on BBC radio. Fwd this msg to as many as you can! A second message displayed in the post mentioned the tasksche.exe file and ransomware attacks. The FBI defines ransomware attacks as \"a type of malicious software — or malware — that prevents you from accessing your computer files, systems or networks, and demands you pay a ransom for their return\": Massive Ransomeware attack...Total 74 countries affected...Please do not open any email which has the attachments with \"tasksche.exe\" file.

The .exe extension for tasksche.exe referenced the executable file format used by the Microsoft Windows operating system. Warning allegedly named for Hillary Clinton On April 7, 2015, Snopes first reported on the \"Dance of the Hillary\" virus warning hoax, then also known as \"Dance of the Pope.\" Five days later, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton formally announced her intention to run for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination for the 2016 election. The blog That's Nonsense, also reporting the warning as a hoax, speculated that the timing of the alleged threat \"likely\" meant the \"Hillary\" in \"Dance of the Hillary\" referenced Clinton, as opposed to a different person. The Sri Lankan arm of the Fact Crescendo fact-checking website previously reported on this matter in May 2025, calling the viral warning a \"recycled hoax.\" For further reading, in 2023, Snopes twice reported on a similar alleged threat that circulated on WhatsApp, in which users warned of the dangers of opening another nonexistent file named \"Seismic Waves Card.\" With that hoax, users vaguely claimed the news of the threat appeared \"on TV,\" somewhat similar to how the \"Dance of the Hillary\" hoax misleadingly mentioned BBC Radio. Snopes' archives contributed to this report.",

    "article_text": "Claim: In a 1999 segment on \"Newsnight,\" musician David Bowie predicted phone addition, viral cat videos, and the phrase social media. Rating: Originated as Satire About this rating Context In 1999, David Bowie discussed the influence of the internet during a segment on \"Newsnight.\" Years later, a parody video was made that grossly exaggerated Bowie's remarks. In January 2022, a video went viral on social media that supposedly showed musician David Bowie giving an eerily accurate prediction of the modern internet age, including the rise in cute cat videos, phone addition, and the specific term \"social media.\" This is not a genuine video of Bowie. This is a parody clip by comedian Michael Spicer. The above-displayed video is a parody of a famous interview the real Bowie gave on Newsnight in 1999. In fact, Spicer's clip above starts with the repetition of a quote from Bowie's original interview (\"I don't think we've even seen the tip of the iceberg. I think the potential of what the Internet is going to do to society, both good and bad, is unimaginable\") before launching into a humorous parody of Bowie's remarks. You can see the original clip around the 6-minute mark of the following video: https://youtu.be/FiK7s_0tGsg?t=365 In the original video, Bowie said that he was originally drawn to music because he felt that it was a rebellious act. In 1999, however, as music was no longer defined by \"leaders\" (one or two big acts, such as The Beatles in the 60s, Elvis Presley in the 50s, etc...), Bowie said that the \"the internet now carries the flag of being subversive and possibly rebellious and chaotic and nihilistic\" and noted how the internet was ushering in a \"demystification process ... between the artist and the audience.\" When interviewer Jeremy Paxman provided some pushback, asking if the hype behind the internet was exaggerated, Bowie said that he absolutely disagreed. \"I don't think we've even seen the tip of the iceberg. I think the potential of what the Internet is going to do to society, both good and bad, is unimaginable. I think we're actually on the cusp of something exhilarating and terrifying [...] I'm talking about the actual context and the state of content is going to be so different to anything that we can really visage at the moment where the interplay between the user and the provider will be so in simpatico that it is going to crus our ideas of what mediums are all about.",

    "article_text": "Claim: The widows or widowers of deceased Google employees receive stock benefits and half their salary for 10 years, and their children collect $1,000 monthly until age 19. Rating: Research In Progress About this rating Context Multiple news outlets reported the claim was true, as of 2012. However, we had not heard back from Google on whether that remained the case, and that the policy had not expired, roughly nine years later. Numerous Snopes readers have sent us versions of the below-displayed meme outlining the purported benefits for immediate relatives of Google employees. According to the rumor, the widows or widowers of deceased Google employees receive stock benefits and half their pay for 10 years, and their children collect $1,000 monthly until age 19. The claim was true, at least as of 2012. But, in order to give it a standard \"True\" fact check rating in 2021, we were waiting on a reply from a company spokesperson to confirm that the policy had not expired. (It is not unusual for companies to change their benefits to employees over time, especially if, or when, the operation changes in size.) Let us elaborate. In August 2012 — roughly nine years before this report —multiple news outlets (The Atlantic here , CNN here , Business Insider here , ABC News here ) highlighted comments by one of the company's former executives in an interview with Forbes . Laszlo Bock , Google's HR chief at the time, said the company had indeed implemented new \"death benefits\" for the surviving spouses and children of employees, according to the Forbes report, which said: Should a U.S. Googler pass away while under the employ of the 14-year old search giant, their surviving spouse or domestic partner will receive a check for 50% of their salary every year for the next decade. Even more surprising, a Google spokesperson confirms that there's \"no tenure requirement\" for this benefit, meaning most of their 34 thousand Google employees qualify. [...] In addition to the 10-year pay package, surviving spouses will see all stocks vested immediately and any children will receive a $1,000 monthly payment from the company until they reach the age of 19 (or 23 if the child is a full-time student). To determine if those policies remained active, we emailed Google's communication team the following questions: As of June 2021, do spouses of Google employees who die receive a check for half of their salary annually for 10 years? If yes to the above question, do all Google employees qualify for the benefit? If not, please explain the criteria for qualifying. Do surviving spouses also see all stocks vested immediately after their partners' death? Do children of deceased Google employees also receive monthly checks of $1,000 until they turn 19? Do those monthly payments extend to older children of deceased Google employees (those under the age of 23) if they're full-time students? Further comments on the company's benefits for surviving relatives of employees? We will update this report when, or if, we receive answers. In the meantime, we also considered data compiled by Levels.fyi, which aggregates reports of various tech companies' workplace conditions, including details on their pay and benefits. And, as of June 9, 2021, that company's overview of Google's benefits ( available here ) affirmed the claim, reading: Lastly, as of this writing, we also considered Google's web page promoting its job opportunities. It says \"we offer generous parental leave policies, retirement savings plans, death benefits , and much more,\" but does not go into detail on the nature or extent of those policies. For that reason, as well as those mentioned above, our research into this rumor remains \"in progress.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: Videos show a DeWalt electric mower catching on fire at Equip Exposition 2022. Rating: True About this rating Context The electric mower that appeared in videos was a \"single pre-production prototype unit,\" according to a company statement. The Lawn & Landscape blog reported that the prototype was part of DeWalt's battery-powered Ascent Series, which wasn't expected to be made available to the public until fall 2023. On Oct. 19, 2022, a DeWalt electric (battery-powered) mower caught on fire at the Equip Exposition 2022 in Louisville, Kentucky. According to a post on the expo's official Facebook page, the fire occurred in an outdoor demo yard. No injuries were reported. Readers asked for more information after seeing various videos and Reddit posts that showed the fire. A popular Facebook post showed two pictures of the fire and read, \"Dewalt broke out their new electric mower at equipment expo…. Hell of a sales pitch 'electric is the future' how about those emissions .\" We reached out to a media contact on DeWalt's website with several questions. The company sent back a brief statement, which was also reported by the Lawn & Landscape blog: A prototype of one of DEWALT's new Ascent mowers caught fire during the Equip Exposition last week in Louisville, Kentucky. Here is the company's statement: \"We are grateful that no one was injured. We are working quickly to determine the cause of the issue with this single pre-production prototype unit and will provide further information when available.\" According to the DeWalt website , the company's Ascent Series mowers are indeed electric (battery-powered), commercial-grade products. The page promoting the mowers displayed, \"Coming Fall 2023,\" which meant that the series wasn't set to be released for around a year. Vehicles powered by electricity, whether they be cars or riding mowers, have become a hot topic in the world of U.S. politics. This has led to quite a few rumors in recent years. For example, earlier in 2022, Facebook users copied and pasted an evidence-free post about John Deere, a company that also manufactures lawn equipment. According to the post, John Deere purportedly asked a farmer to convert his equipment to electric-power tractors and combines by the year 2023. The farmer then supposedly posed a number of questions in response, apparently leaving the company representative speechless. However, as we reported in August, the company said it doesn't even have plans for any battery-operated or electric large tractors and combines, which called the whole story into question.",

The 4 November 2017 post pushing the claim that the tech corporation had chosen to build a second headquarters (or \"HQ2\") in San Diego, California was initially published on chicagotimesnews.com, but by the time it came to our attention, it had been taken down. A cached version of the site shows little more than a headline and one line from the story: A Google search also shows the fake headline topping searches for \"Amazon chooses San Diego,\" with no advisory for readers: Not surprisingly, a search for \"Amazon San Diego\" on Twitter reveals that several users blindly shared the big news, only to later realize it was bogus. It is true that the company received 238 bids from prospective host sites for its planned new campus. Amazon has said that it would create up to 50,000 jobs for HQ2. But while Amazon signed a lease for a new office in San Diego in September 2017, the final decision on where HQ2 will be located has not been announced. The San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation confirmed to us on 6 November 2017 that it submitted a bid on behalf of the region for the facility.",

The claim is false. \"USA FINALLY BANNED TIKTOK,\" one Twitter user said above a photograph of a person breaking chains from wrists. \"Congress has officially banned TikTok,\" said another post. USA FINALLY BANNED TIKTOK pic.twitter.com/6gVApx3zJk — kira* (@kiracantmizz) March 23, 2023 While TikTok was banned in December 2021 from being used on U.S. federal government devices, there had not been a general ban placed on the app for private citizens in the U.S. at the time of publication. Both the White House and Congress had been exploring different options to further regulate the app, including a possible general ban, but no final decision had been reached. We'll update this check in the future if that happens. The Biden Administration has cited national security concerns over TikTok being owned by Chinese company ByteDance as the reason for a potential ban. A bi-partisan Senate bill that the White House endorsed in March 2023 could give the federal government the power to generally ban TikTok for U.S. users. Called the RESTRICT Act, it would allow the U.S. secretary of commerce to broadly regulate technology produced by countries that have adversarial relationships with the U.S., including China. At the time of this publication, it had been introduced in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. The White House also reportedly threatened a potential TikTok ban if ByteDance, the Chinese company that owned the app at the time of publication, refused to sell the company. Such a sale would have to be approved by China's government due to the country's export regulations . China said it would oppose such a sale at the time of this writing. In August 2020, former U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order that imposed wide-ranging sanctions on TikTok. It was legally blocked in court. In June 2021, Biden revoked those executive orders and replaced them with his own, which set criteria for the U.S. government to evaluate the risk of apps connected to foreign adversaries. According to Insider , at least 27 U.S. states had banned the app from government devices at the time of this publication, including Texas, North Carolina, and Maryland. Other countries like India and Norway have either permanently banned TikTok or banned the app from work devices. We've previously fact-checked other claims about TikTok, like whether the platform was banned in China. If you see any claims you think we should fact-check about TikTok regulations, you can send them using our contact form or by emailing izz@snopes.com.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Full-body imaging machines used by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) show a person’s private parts whenever they “walk through the X-ray scanner.” Rating: Outdated About this rating Context The image above showing examples of TSA full-body scans is authentic and was captured using the agency's backscatter unit, hundreds of which were installed in U.S. airports in 2010. The devices were removed nationwide by 2013, however. In January 2024, a viral post on X (formerly known as Twitter) made a salacious claim about what exactly the Transport Security Administration (TSA) could see using its scanners. According to the post, dated Jan. 18, 2024, the TSA \"can see your c*ck and b*lls whenever you walk through the X-ray scanner.\" The post (screenshot below) received hundreds of thousands of views before it was hidden by the user. An archived version still exists. (@Ragland1836 / X) Though the image included in the post was genuine, Snopes determined through a reverse-image search using Yandex ( archived ) that the earliest known instance of the photo on the internet was posted in 2010 . Posts similar to the one above have circulated for many years. At that time (2010), TSA was rolling out its new body-scanning technology, the so-called \"backscatter unit.\" \"Backscatter technology projects low level X-ray beams over the body to create a reflection of the body displayed on the monitor,\" explained TSA in a \"How It Works\" blog, noting that the technology \"produces an image that resembles a chalk etching.\" By the end of 2010, hundreds of \"full-body scanners\" were formally installed at U.S. airports, according to TSA . Such units were used to detect non-metallic weapons explosives and other threats that could be concealed under clothing to evade traditional metal detectors already in place. \"Backscatter passenger scanners are used to detect threats such as weapons or explosives that a person could be carrying under their clothing. Backscatter machines use very low energy x-rays that are reflected back to the machine itself,\" wrote the Environmental Protection Agency in a digital explainer. \"Generally, the amount of radiation received from a backscatter machine equals the amount of cosmic radiation received during two minutes of flight and the risk of health effects is very, very low.\" Handouts distributed at the time indicated that images voluntarily collected were \"viewed in a remote location\" and were not saved or stored, but rather were immediately deleted \" after review and resolution of any anomaly .\" But backscatter scanners were short-lived. Deemed by some as \" digital strip searches ,\" the machines were removed from U.S. airports after users expressed concern over the lack of privacy. TSA, on the other hand, noted that the scanners slowed down security checkpoints . Millimeter-wave technology similar to those commonly used in airports at the time of this publication r eplaced the backscatter scanners , offering a more cartoon-like (i.e., less revealing) image of people as they passed through the scanners.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A photograph shows an electric car charging at a diesel generator, which uses 36 gallons to provide a 200-mile charge. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True This photograph shows an electric car charging at a diesel generator in 2018. What's False This image does not depict a typical circumstance for electric vehicles. The photograph was taken in the Australian outback, not the United States, where gas stations are scarce (and electric charging stations are even scarcer). The picture documents a privately-funded project, not one backed by a major electric car company, and the diesel fuel used provided the equivalent of 42 MPG, not 5.6. By the time of this writing in 2021, the charging station (dubbed the \"Chargepod\") was running on biodiesel fuel. A photograph that supposedly shows an electric car inefficiently charging at a station powered by diesel fuel is frequently shared on social media, along with messages denigrating the electric vehicle industry: This photograph does show an electric car charging at a power station fueled by diesel fuel in 2018. However, the accompanying message contains several incorrect or misleading claims. To start with, the types of stations are not \"popping up everywhere.\" The photograph captures a privately-funded charging station dubbed the \"Chargepod\" in the Australian outback, an area of the world that does not currently have the infrastructure to support long-distance travel in electric cars, where station was built by retired engineer and electric vehicle owner Jon Edwards as a stopgap until more permanent (and greener) stations could be installed. In other words, this picture is of a one-of-a-kind charging station built to solve a specific problem in a rural area. We're not sure where the statistics in the accompanying text came from, but they were not the product of Edwards' testing. In 2018, Edwards installed the ChargePod on his property and invited several members of the Tesla Owner's Club of Western Australia (TOCWA) to come test it. Although the station did not provide a perfectly green solution for supporting electric cars (they were still burning fossil fuels, after all), the results were much better than described in the above-displayed meme. Edwards and the TOCWA found that this charging station provided about the equivalent of 100 kilometers of travel per 5.6 liters of fuel, a rate approximately equal to 42 miles per gallon. More information about the fuel efficiency of the ChargePod is available here : While Edwards' initial version of the ChargePod used diesel fuel, he has since improved upon his original design by modifying his self-funded station to run on biodiesel (a non-fossil fuel), as the Driven reported : As we shared in 2018, retired engineer Jon Edwards and a group of EV drivers set up an electric vehicle charger powered by a diesel generator at his property outside Perth to test if charging from diesel was a viable option to take the load off generators at roadhouses that line the long highways across Western Australia's deserts. The testing proved that this was actually greener than one might assume. But Edwards tells The Driven that after being \"hammered on social media\", he decided to look into using biodiesel – that is, waste vegetable oil from roadhouse fryers – to power a stand-alone charging solution instead. \"The first version built was a diesel-driven unit named ChargePod, and I put it up in Jurien Bay at the Caltex for a 6 months trial,\" says Edwards. \"It worked well, the EV drivers loved getting 50kW charging halfway to Geraldton, it but it got hammered on social media.\" Edwards says this was fair enough, and so the Biofil was born. \"The next version was Biofil, same idea but running on waste vegetable oil rather than diesel. While still not entirely ideal, it is renewable energy, not fossil fuel, and it is carbon-neutral,\" he says. This viral photograph truly shows an electric vehicle charging via a diesel fuel generator, but the picture is often shared with misleading or inaccurate claims. This photograph does not depict a common charging station but rather a rather unique charging station which was privately funded as one person's attempt to provide a temporary solution enabling electric vehicles to drive long distances across the sparsely populated Australian outback. The fuel-efficiency of the diesel \"Chargepod\" was far better than stated in this meme, and the station has since been upgraded to use non-fossil biodiesel.",

    "article_text": "Claim: To be most effective, the direction of a ceiling fan's rotation should be clockwise in the winter and counterclockwise in the summer. Rating: True About this rating In November 2022, a Facebook post went viral, likely because the Facebook user expressed surprise to learn a piece of information that most members of the public likely don't know: Ceiling fans have different settings for summer and winter, and the direction of the blades' rotation matters in terms of their effectiveness. This is true for fans that have this option. The direction the ceiling fan's blades rotate during the summer and winter months makes a difference. Home appliance and repair retailer Home Depot explains why on its website: Ceiling fan direction in the winter should be clockwise, and the fan should run at the lowest speed. This pulls cool air up toward the ceiling, which in turn displaces the warm air that rises and collects near the ceiling. A clockwise ceiling fan direction for high ceilings is especially important in winter. It moves the warmer air trapped at the very top of the room down. The air flows toward the floor and along the walls. This makes the room feel warmer, allowing you to lower the thermostat. The low speed prevents any drafty \"wind chill\" and keeps the airflow steady and consistent. When standing under the fan, look up and double-check that the blades are rotating in a clockwise direction. The opposite is true during the summer, again per Home Depot's website: A ceiling fan should rotate counterclockwise in the summer, so the blades push cooler air down in a column. This is the best ceiling fan direction for air conditioning since it makes the air feel cooler than it is. It allows you to turn your thermostat up a few degrees. Ceiling fans are an occasional source of internet rumors and lore. A claim spread in 2018 that falsely reported a Florida babysitter tied a one-month old baby to a ceiling fan for 26 hours. Another false rumor in 2008 claimed people sleeping in rooms with running ceiling fans often inexplicably died.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A vintage photograph authentically shows a deep-sea diving suit that existed in the 1920s. Rating: True About this rating Fact Check A vintage photograph perennially shared on social media purports to show an actual deep-sea diving suit from 1925 that looks more like a mash-up of the Tin Man from \"The Wizard of Oz\" and Robby the Robot , the clunky (but lovable) robot character in the 1956 science fiction film \"Forbidden Planet.\" Here's the photograph as posted on Facebook : As we'll document below, both the photograph (which actually dates from 1931) and the suit are genuine. But let's talk first about about why people seem to find this picture so shareworthy. Is it because in 1925 full-body diving suits were a novelty? No, because they weren't. What's known as a \" standard diving dress \" — consisting of a metal helmet, a hose to supply air pumped in from the surface, a canvas diving suit, and boots — was developed in the 19th century and in wide use by the early 20th. The photograph below shows a well-worn standard diving suit in use in the 1920s and '30s. It's likely what most people picture when they think of vintage, deep-sea diving gear. A 1920s- 1930s professional underwater deep sea diver in diving suit with breathing gas supply and hard hat helmet. (Photo by H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty Images) The differences between standard diving dress and the rigid, robot-like contraption in the viral photo are readily apparent. Some people may be shocked to learn that the latter was real. \"Submarine armor,\" as the all-metal diving suit equipped with special rotary joints for mobility was dubbed in the title of its 1914 patent application , was intended by its inventor, Harry L. Bowdoin of New Jersey, to offer divers a stronger, more efficient alternative to the standard dress for accomplishing underwater tasks, particularly in very deep water. It was also intended to enrich the inventor himself. According to its prospectus, \"The Deep Sea Salvage Corporation,\" a company Bowdoin started in 1916, \"has been organized to construct and operate a metal diving suit to be used for deep sea diving, locating and recovering specie and other valuables contained in the cargoes of sunken ships at depths which it has been impossible to reach with the diving apparatus ordinarily in use.\" A laundry list of Bowdoin's planned deep-sea, fortune-hunting destinations took up more than half of a May 1916 article about him in Vermont's Rutland Daily Herald. It took Bowdoin 12 years to build and perfect the suit, which in the end weighed 1,400 pounds and was all too often described in the press as a \"robot.\" (The viral Facebook photo can also be found on Getty Images , where it has a caption identifying the man standing beside the suit as the inventor himself.) Bowdoin launched his first actual expedition in search of tens of millions of dollars worth of sunken treasure in 1928, at the age of 60. \"The inventive Long Islander was not over-willing to talk of his brain-child and the feats he hopes to accomplish,\" reported the New York Daily News in April of that year. \"Wait until I get the money,\" Bowdoin told the paper. New York Daily News , April 11, 1928 Though Bowdoin's \"submarine armor\" performed as he expected under deep-sea conditions, it doesn't appear that his fortune-hunting ventures resulted in that much success. When he died in 1935, his obituary made much of Bowdoin's diving apparatus and a new expedition on which he was preparing to embark, but had little to say about the outcomes of his previous attempts to recover sunken treasure. Except, the obituary noted, a voyage two years prior yielded nothing but an empty safe.",

Rating: False About this rating Context In reality, relatively no one used the search engine to look for the answer to the question, according to Google Trends, which tracks how many users have conducted searches using specific keyword phrases. The erroneous claim stemmed from research with flawed methodology, and its author acknowledged the factual inaccuracies. In late April 2021, social media posts, like the one displayed below, Google users allegedly asked the search engine \"how to a hit a woman so now one knows\" more often during the first phase of lockdowns to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in 2020 than during the same time frame the previous year. The claim originated from media sources including Blavity (a Los Angeles-based platform serving Black millennials), UNILAD (a British media outlet), and MSNBC (an American cable network owned by NBC Universal). We obtained an archived version of an April 26 opinion column by the latter outlet, a piece of commentary that cited peer-reviewed research analyzing Google searches from the beginning of the U.S. COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020 to the end of August that year. The MSNBC article said: [Millions] of men appear to be doing some very specific research about how to assault the women around them. Published in The Journal of General Psychology, the study was led by Katerina Standish, the deputy director and senior lecturer at the National Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Otago in New Zealand. 'How to hit a woman so no one knows' was typed into Google 163 million times, a 31 percent increase compared to 2019. In other words, Google users purportedly searched \"how to hit a woman so no one knows\" 163 million times between March and August 2020, and that number was 31 percent higher than the amount of same searches during those months the previous year. However, that was not true. One day after the MSNBC column published, onlookers identified flaws in the research's methodology, and its author confirmed the findings were inaccurate. As a result, the news outlet removed the above-transcribed section from its article citing the research. (That updated version of the story remained live online as of this writing.) We looked at Google search data ourselves. By searching the phrase \"how to hit a woman so no one knows,\" the platform produces billions of returns — or websites or posts that contain those keywords. That is not the same as the number of times users searched the question (we explain how to find that quantity below), and it appeared to grow significantly after the MSNBC article and other media coverage. By using the separate Google Trends search engine -- a tool that compiles data for Google search queries worldwide -- we learned that relatively no one used the website to look for information on \"how to hit a woman so no one knows,\" including during the time window referenced in the study (March to August 2020). Next, to fully explore the issue, we reached out to Standish (the author of the study called, \" COVID-19, suicide, and femicide: Rapid Research using Google search phrase \") to learn about her research process and its shortcomings. She responded to us via email, saying she indeed mistook the amount of search returns for the number of times Google users entered the phrase looking for answers. After the revelation, she said she alerted The Journal of General Psychology of the error and requested an assessment of the entire study. \"The results are meaningless ... all I have done is demonstrate a rise in web pages over the year. Not at all what I thought I was doing,\" Standish said. \"[The] goal of the study was to look for people who were hurting to elevate what they are going through and to help.\" Additionally, Standish apologized for the research's flaws on Twitter: \"The first time I googled these terms my heart skipped...I was shocked,\" she continued in a tweet thread. \"I sincerely apologise and will make amends.\" In sum, we rate this claim \"false\" — millions of people, presumably men, did not turn to Google for help to seemingly conceal physical abuse against their female partners during the early months of the pandemic.

    "article_text": "Claim: Kodak invented the world's first portable, digital camera in the 1970s, but didn't release the technology for public sale until years later to avoid hits to the company's photographic-film business. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True Kodak engineer Steve Sasson invented the first portable, digital camera in 1975. Kodak received a patent for the device in 1978, but did not put it into production. What's False While Kodak did not push forward with production in 1975 and challenged the wisdom of moving away from its camera-film market, the company's reasoning for not developing it then was largely due to the device not being ready or practical for the market. A long-standing internet claim holds that the film and camera company Eastman Kodak invented the first digital camera, but kept the invention hidden from the public because of the threat it posed to its photographic-film-based business model: Aspects of this meme are true. Though larger-scale applications involving the digitization of images already existed, Kodak engineer Steve Sasson created the first portable digital camera in 1975. He demonstrated the product to the company's executives, and they decided to patent the technology but not to develop it for sale. It is an oversimplification to say that a fear over a future film-less world led Kodak to \"hide\" the invention from the public, in part because it neglects the fact that the product was not ready at the time, that no real market for the product existed in 1975, and that Kodak further developed digital cameras following this initial invention. Kodak received substantial sums from the patent it received for Sasson's device in 1978, as well. In 1973, at age 23, Sasson took a job as an electrical engineer at Kodak. As described by The New York Times in 2015, \"soon after arriving at Kodak, Mr. Sasson was given a seemingly unimportant task — to see whether there was any practical use for a charged coupled device (CCD), which had been invented a few years earlier.\" Such devices can translate light to digital signals, and are key to all digital cameras. Two years later, he had finished his device — a Frankensteined mishmash of leftover lenses, circuits, and a cassette tape for memory. As described by the Times: The final result was a Rube Goldberg device with a lens scavenged from a used Super-8 movie camera; a portable digital cassette recorder; 16 nickel cadmium batteries; an analog/digital converter; and several dozen circuits — all wired together on half a dozen circuit boards. By 1976, Sasson was ready to demo the invention to executives at Kodak, as he described to the photography outlet PetaPixel: \"I would walk in with my crazy-looking camera, which was about the size of a toaster, but I could hold it,\" Sasson says. \"I took pictures of people in the room before I said anything. Then I took out the tape that the digital information was stored on and put it in the playback unit when a picture popped up on the TV screen. And that generally got everybody's attention.\" \"Indeed, they didn't ask me how this worked,\" Sasson says. They simply asked me why anybody would want to take a picture this way when there was nothing wrong with conventional photography. Nobody [including the bosses at Kodak] was asking me to develop this camera. In fact, nobody even knew that I was developing this camera. The file size of the picture it produced — a black, white, and gray grid of 100 by 100 pixels — was 5 kilobytes. It took nearly a half a minute to save the data from the image to a cassette tape. \"It only took 50 milliseconds to capture the image, but it took 23 seconds to record it to the tape,\" Sasson said . When asked how long before this technology could match that of a film camera, Sasson figured it was about 15-20 years away. At the time, the photographs had to be displayed on a TV. Personal computers were far from ubiquitous — the first Apple I computer kit was released a year later in 1976. Business and marketing directors at Kodak were, indeed, skeptical of the wisdom of creating a product that could potentially make their photographic-film business obsolete. As reported in the Times, \"Kodak's marketing department was not interested in [Sasson's prototypes]. Mr. Sasson was told they could sell the camera, but wouldn't — because it would eat away at the company's film sales.\" While this may have been a motivating factor to some at Kodak, such concerns did not stop Kodak — or even Sasson — from further developing digital cameras and making several technical developments that led to Kodak's first publicly available digital camera in 1991, the Digital Camera System. As reported in a 1991 Associated Press article: Eastman Kodak Co is taking its first step into filmless photography with an electronic camera system that can turn a conventional Nikon into a high-tech electronic camera. The Professional Digital Camera System will sell for about $20000. It is intended primarily for photojournalists and government surveillance, Kodak said. Sasson's developments were crucial to develop this technology. In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama awarded Sasson the National Medal of Technology and Innovation for his contributions to digital photography. Because the first portable digital camera was, indeed, invented in 1975 by Kodak, but because concerns about destroying its film business did not stop Kodak from developing the technology further, we rate this claim as a \"Mixture\" of truth.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A photograph shows hundreds of white electric cars that were abandoned in France because the cost of replacing the batteries was too expensive. Rating: Miscaptioned About this rating On Oct. 12, 2022, an \" alternative-health guru \" named David \"Avocado\" Wolfe tweeted a false meme on the subject of electric vehicles (EVs). The meme claimed to display a photograph that had been taken in France showing hundreds of electric cars that were abandoned due to the high cost of EV battery replacement. However, this caption was very misleading. The meme was engaged with tens of thousands of times. The misleading caption read, \"France: They bought electric cars for civil servants but it was too expensive to replace the batteries. After that, no one else wanted the cars. Now they are here.\" The helpful Twitter account @HoaxEye of hoaxeye.com was quick to debunk the meme. HoaxEye's tweet linked to a comprehensive investigation from The Observers on France24.com . The Observers previously reported that the picture was taken not in France, but rather just outside of Hangzhou, China. They cited several different sources . The photographer who captured the picture was Instagram user @gregabandoned , who explores abandoned places around the world. The cars in the picture belonged to an electric car-sharing company that was named Microcity. Thousands of their Kandi-brand vehicles hit the streets in 2013. However, The Observers reported that there wasn't enough demand for their business. The company went bankrupt in 2019. There's no data to show that EV battery replacement costs had anything to do with the reason the cars were abandoned. We previously reported on other photos that had a similar caption about abandoned electric cars, EV battery replacement costs, and France. In that case, the pictures truly were captured in France. The BlueCar fleet was owned by Autolib, also an electric car-sharing service. However, once again, the electric cars in those pictures were not abandoned because of expensive EV batteries. Instead, a failed business model was to blame, just like with Microcity.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A video shows a sea of lined-up electric scooter bikes that were abandoned because of the high cost of EV battery replacement. Rating: Miscaptioned About this rating On Nov. 28, 2022, the @Xx17965797N Twitter account tweeted a video with a misleading caption that claimed the clip showed a sea of lined-up electric scooter bikes that were abandoned because of the high cost of electric vehicle (EV) battery replacement. The tweet read, \"Electric green scooters that have reached end of battery life. Due to the batteries being so expensive to replace, electric scooters are abandoned because disposing of them any other way is dangerous and expensive.\" This was not true, despite the tens of thousands of combined retweets and likes that the tweet received. The same video upload from @Xx17965797N was also misleadingly reshared by accounts including @PeterDClack , @JamesMelville , and @MillerForTexas . The former two tweets received thousands of engagements, despite the fact that the information pushed in the original tweet was not true. In cases like these where a caption is incorrect but the picture or video is real, we issue a fact-check rating of \"Miscaptioned.\" The Origins of the Video Days before the @Xx17965797N tweet was posted, the @ElevaBrasilES account also misleadingly tweeted that the same video was shot in France. The tweet went up on Nov. 21 with an incorrect caption that read, \"Green energy… Cemetery of electric motorcycles in France. Now designated as a 'biohazard zone.'\" ( Note: This mention of France reminded us of other rumors we've debunked in the past, in particular about two photos of other car graveyards. The two pictures showed false captions that claimed the cars had been abandoned due to the high cost of battery replacement, just like the video we're looking at in this fact check.) The oldest upload of the video that we could find came from TikTok user @smartsetting. The video was uploaded on Nov. 7 and by the end of the month had received nearly 5 million views. Based on watching the video, the scooters appeared to be parked in a parking lot near a basketball court, perhaps in a university complex or public park. Several blurry Chinese characters were visible on the side of the bikes. At the end of the clip, a tall building could be seen on the right-hand side of the frame. Other than those pieces of information, we didn't have much to go on. How We Researched the Rumor In order to find the truth behind this video, we first used Adobe Media Encoder to export a JPEG file for each and every frame from the video. The results of this export were 440 individual images from the 14-second video. We then performed numerous reverse image searches with these picture files using Google Images and TinEye.com. These reverse image searches provided several clues as to where other users had reposted the video. However, we did not find any further details from these searches. Next, we tried several searches on Google, Twitter, and YouTube with phrases such as \"electric scooter China\" and \"electric bike graveyard China,\" among other terms. This helped to find several reposts of the video. The searches also showed results for many of the sites in China that are the final resting places for massive stacks of bicycles dumped by bike-sharing companies with failed business models . Perhaps the most striking video we found was titled, \"No Place To Place——The Wonders of Shared Bicycle Graveyards in China.\" At one point in our research, we stumbled upon an AFP video from 2021 that appeared to show the same yellow color and model of electric scooter bike. The caption for the clip said that it was captured \"outside the city of Shenyang.\" The end of the video showed a stadium with special colors for seating zones. After an exhaustive search, we were able to find this same stadium by using the map tools on the Chinese website Baidu.com . Unlike Google Maps, Baidu.com has street-level views of nearby roads. However, this part of our effort wasn't very helpful. It remained unclear if this was the same location where the viral clip was shot. Finally, a Lead In the end, it was going back to TikTok that helped us find the origins of the video. A search on TikTok for \"electric share bike China\" brought us to this video from @evstevepan. The video showed the same kind of yellow electric scooter bike with a similar logo. A scan of the logo using a mobile phone camera and Google Translate revealed the company name Meituan, which is known as an \"all-encompassing platform for local services.\" The logos appeared to be similar. (Courtesy: @smartsetting/@evstevepan on TikTok) We then searched the internet for Meituan and electric scooters, which produced plenty of pictures on Shutterstock.com. For a moment, the two large characters on the side of the scooter didn't seem to match those from the viral video. We then horizontally flipped a still-frame from the viral video, which led us to discover that it had been mirrored, meaning that all words and numbers were backward. It's blurry, but it's a match. \"App\" appears on the left, too. (Courtesy: @smartsetting/@evstevepan on TikTok) All of these developments in our research led us to news articles that helped to show our findings were lining up. Meituan 'Walked Away' from Bike-Sharing In April 2018, news broke that Meituan had purchased the company Mobike for $2.7 billion. According to the story, Mobike is \"a Chinese startup that helped pioneer bike-sharing services worldwide.\" But by November of that same year, TechCrunch reported that Meituan would be \"[walking] away from bike-sharing and ride-hailing,\" as there wasn't enough demand from customers for the supply of its bike-sharing venture: In April, Meituan entered the bike-sharing fray after it scooped up top player Mobike for $2.7 billion to face off Alibaba-backed Ofo. Over the past few years, Mobike and Ofo were burning through large sums of investor money in a bid to win users from subsidized rides, but both have shown signs of softening their stance recently. Mobike is downsizing its fleets to \"avoid an oversupply\" as the bike-sharing market falters, Meituan's chief financial officer Chen Shaohui said during the earnings call. Ofo has also scaled back by closing down many of its international operations. ... During its third quarter that ended September 30, Meituan posted a 97.2 percent jump on revenues to 19.1 billion yuan, or $2.75 billion, on the back of strong growth in food delivery transactions. The firm's investments in new initiatives – including ride-hailing and bike-sharing – took a toll as operating losses nearly tripled to 3.45 billion yuan compared to a year ago. Meituan shares plunged as much as 14 percent on Friday, the most since its spectacular listing. Just as so many electric bicycles from bike-sharing companies had piled up across China, so had electric scooters like the ones seen in the viral video. In sum, social media users falsely claimed that a video showed tons of lined-up electric scooter bikes that were abandoned in a \"graveyard\" due to the high cost of EV battery replacement. All evidence pointed to a simple answer: supply and demand. The number of electric scooter bikes and bicycles far outnumbered the number of people who requested to use them (or else they went missing or were stolen ), which resulted in downsizing by some companies, and the closure of others. The clip appears to have been shot in China, although its precise location is unclear. We reached out to Meituan for comment on Nov. 29 but did not receive a response in time for publication.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A photo from the early 1900s shows a charging station for an electric bus. Rating: True About this rating A photo often shared on social media purportedly shows an electric bus driving into a \"charging and power station\" in the early 1900s. The picture shows an authentic bus charging station operated by the London Electrobus Company during that company's short existence between 1906 and 1909. A version of this photo appears in the Getty Images archives. As reported by The Economist in 2007, these charging stations were not plug-in stations as we know them today, but instead were facilities in which old batteries were swapped for fresh ones: The electrobus needed 1.5 tonnes of lead-acid batteries to carry its 34 passengers. It could travel 60km (38 miles) on one charge. So at lunchtime the buses went to a garage in Victoria and drove up a ramp. The batteries, slung under the electrobus, were lowered onto a trolley and replaced with fresh ones. It all took three minutes. An ad for the company indicated that they had two charging and power stations for electric buses located at 1 Earl Street and 45 Horseferry Road in London. Here is another close-up photo of one such \"electrobus\" from 1907: By several reports , the buses were a hit, thanks to their reduced noise and smoother ride. In debuting their first bus in 1906, the directors of the company said that they \"confidently anticipate that the petrol omnibus, young as it is, will shortly be an obsolete vehicle, so far as urban traffic is concerned.\" It was not to be. The company was beset by allegations of fraud during its effort to go public on the London Stock Exchange in 1908. As described in The Economist, the company had been duped by a team of con artists: The firm was buying rights to a patent for £20,000 (£7.5m, or $15m, in today's money) from the Baron de Martigny. But the patent was old and had nothing to do with battery buses. It was a scam. Investors asked for their money back, and the firm had to return £80,000. The investors would have been even less impressed had they known the true identity of the \"Baron\", who was a Canadian music-hall artist. Martigny was only the front man. The mastermind behind this and a clutch of subsequent scams was Edward Lehwess, a German lawyer and serial con-artist with a taste for fast cars and expensive champagne. After this initial fiasco, the London Electrobus Company struggled to raise money. But Lehwess had set up a network of front companies to siphon off its funds. Chief among these was the Electric Vehicle Company of West Norwood, which built the buses. The company collapsed entirely in 1909. Because, however, the photo is in several archives and the buses and their charging stations are documented in newspaper accounts from that time, the claim is \"True.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: Eli Lilly and Company announced on Twitter that \"insulin is free now.\" Rating: Labeled Satire About this rating On Nov. 10, 2022, a Twitter account with a \"verified\" checkmark badge and a display name of \"Eli Lilly and Company\" tweeted, \"We are excited to announce insulin is free now.\" The account's handle was @EliLiIlyandCo. However, this was nothing more than a parody account, as its bio clearly said. The message was engaged with tens of thousands of times. At last check, it was nearing 20,000 combined reweets, quote tweets, and likes. If readers were to pretend for a moment they were in the pre-Elon Musk era of Twitter, before the Tesla CEO bought the company, the message would be spectacular news to those who need the hormone. After all, the account was \"verified,\" right? But in the beginning of Musk's reign, \"verification\" was not what it used to be on Twitter, as many satirists had already shown. The satirists created a seemingly endless number of fake accounts that impersonated various personalities and companies. The storm of fake accounts came after Musk announced that the social media platform would begin allowing anyone with $8 to receive a checkmark badge. The \"blue checkmark\" trust signal was previously only doled out by the platform if an account met certain criteria and was verified to be who they said they were. After the parody tweet had remained available for several hours, Eli Lilly and Company tweeted a brief statement on its real account, @LillyPad. Later in the day, a context label appeared under the tweet to let people know it was an impersonation account. The Eli Lilly and Company logo was also removed from its profile picture. Users can confirm whether a Twitter account purchased a \"verified\" checkmark by clicking on it. If the checkmark says that \"it's notable in government, news, entertainment, or another designated category,\" then it truly has been verified. Clicking on accounts that have paid $8 to receive a checkmark are marked with a different label that reads, \"This account is verified because it's subscribed to Twitter Blue.\" On the day before all of this went down, Musk had tweeted , \"Please note that Twitter will do lots of dumb things in coming months. We will keep what works & change what doesn't.\" We previously reported about quite a few other \"verified\" parody accounts, including ones that impersonated LeBron James, Rudy Giuliani, and Ben Shapiro, to name a few.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Elon Musk's account was briefly suspended by an outgoing Twitter employee. Rating: False About this rating On Nov. 4, 2022, Twitter users began to share a false rumor that claimed, \"An outgoing Twitter employee suspended Elon Musk's account on their way out.\" The tweet below received more than 100,000 combined retweets and likes. Users shared a screenshot that appeared to show Musk's account, @elonmusk, had truly been suspended. The screenshot was real. However, the second letter of the handle was an uppercase \"i,\" not a lowercase \"L.\" As many readers are no doubt aware, these letters look identical in some fonts. Reuters fact-check journalist Seana Davis shed light on the matter in a tweet , adding that, \"The suspended account has duped plenty over the past few months.\" The context behind the \"outgoing Twitter employee\" false tweet was in regard to widespread layoffs at the company. The firings had begun on the day before the rumor started making its way around Twitter, coming just one week after the news that Musk was the company's new owner. The Associated Press reported that the total number of firings at Twitter was not yet known. The company reportedly had 7,500 employees on its payroll before the layoffs were carried out.",

Rating: False About this rating On Dec. 4, 2022, a YouTube channel named Elon Musk Rewind posted a video promoting a rumor that claimed Tesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk had bought General Motors, the automobile company better known as GM. The video's title read, \"BREAKING NEWS! Elon Musk JUST OFFICIALLY BOUGHT General Motors!\" Other similarly-named channels also posted the purported news, including Elon Musk Now, Elon Musk Zone, Futurity, and Elon Musk Live. None of this was true. However, this news was false. Musk had not bought GM, nor had he announced any plans to do so. We found a disclaimer of sorts at the bottom of the description in the video posted by Elon Musk Rewind. It read, \"Our channel is purely made for entertainment purposes, based on facts, rumors, and fiction.\" In this case, the rumor was completely fictional. Musk and GM previously made headlines after his October 2022 purchase of Twitter. On Oct. 28, CNBC reported that GM was \"pausing\" its advertising on Twitter \"to understand the direction of the platform under [Musk's] new ownership.\" Then, on December 6, GM CEO Mary Barra explained to CNBC that it had decided to suspend ads on Twitter due to the fact that Musk's electric vehicle company, Tesla, is a competitor. We previously reported that Musk had not bought Google , a rumor that also stemmed from some of the aforementioned Musk-centric YouTube channels.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Elon Musk bought Google. Rating: False About this rating In early January 2023, readers asked if a rumor was true that said Twitter owner Elon Musk had bought Google. However, this claim was false. At the same time that this rumor was beginning spread, readers were flocking to one of our past stories about another rumor that claimed Musk's father, Errol, once owned an emerald mine . The rumor about Musk buying Google started on Jan. 8 when the user or users behind a YouTube channel named Elon Musk Zone posted a new video with the title, \"Elon Musk: 'I OFFICIALLY Bought Google.'\" The video began by announcing, \"Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has shocked many after he officially bought Google.\" The thumbnail image for the video showed a doctored picture of Musk with Google CEO Sundar Pichai, as HITC.com noted in its reporting about this rumor. The thumbnail image for the video was fake. A disclaimer buried in the YouTube video's description read somewhat like those that we've see on websites that claim to publish satire and parody. However, this disclaimer did not mention the words \"satire\" or \"parody.\" Instead, the disclaimer only said the following: \"Our channel is not associated with Elon Musk in ANY way and is purely made for entertainment purposes, based on facts, rumors, and fiction. Nothing in this video is financial or medical advice.\" The beginning of the fictional story that was presented in the video was narrated as follows: Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has shocked many after he officially bought Google. What is Musk up to in the tech industry, given his pace of buying tech companies? Will Sundar Pichai survive as Google's CEO after Musk's takeover, or will he be fired like the former Twitter CEO, Parag Agrawal? Will Google be better off or worse off after Musk's takeover? Join me today in this video where we will explore how Elon Musk has officially bought Google. In your wildest dreams, would you have ever thought that Elon Musk could buy the world's largest search-engine company, Google? Well, I can bet you never did. However, let's just face it. Elon Musk is full of surprises, and we should be expecting more from the tech guru. So, Elon Musk has just lost his first position as the world's richest man in the world to LVMH's Bernard Arnault. Yet, to this tech nerd, net worth is just a number. He has a lot more wealth than we can imagine. Nevertheless, his most recent purchase has left many surprised as to his capabilities. Just recently, Elon Musk successfully bought and freed the bird (Twitter) from the deal that drew a whopping $44 billion from his pocket. We all know the Twitter story, and how it wound to Elon buying it. But one thing is clear after the purchase of the American microblogging social media site: Elon Musk is hailed as the hero of free speech. If readers see any questionable YouTube videos in the future, we recommend completely reading through the description of the video as well as checking the \"About\" page for the channel. One or both of those places might include a disclaimer much like the one we found under the fictional video from Elon Musk Zone.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A screenshot from April 2024 shows a real Elon Musk tweet claiming that, within 20 years, robots would exist that were sexually compatible with humans and that would act like a \"housewife who never nags.\" Rating: Unfounded About this rating On April 27, 2024, a post on X containing a screenshot of an ALLEGED X post made by the company's owner, Elon Musk, appeared for the first time. The post in the screenshot read as follows: Indistinguishable-from-human robot companions will be mainstream in 15-20 years, and yes, you will be able to have sex with them. A housewife who never nags. Beautiful and customized to your taste. No one belittling ... the \"disgusting\" way you make love (X user @schizarella) The screenshotted post was timestamped to the prior afternoon — April 26, 2024, at 15:40 (3:40 p.m.). Over the next few days, the image went viral, with users sharing the screenshot of Musk's supposed post and remarking about the billionaire's habit for saying rather eccentric things. Snopes was unable to definitively confirm that the image was fake, so we have rated this claim \"Unfounded.\" However, we have strong reason to suspect that the post was not real. We investigated Musk's posting history on X, but found no post on his timeline matching what the screenshot purported to show. If the post was deleted, as some users claimed, we could find no evidence of that, despite checking archived versions of Musk's feed using the Wayback Machine. Searching on X to see discussion around the post didn't reveal anything other than the screenshot — an unusual fact considering audience metrics suggested readers viewed the alleged post 46 million times and reposted it 22,000 times. Next, we turned to the origin of the image. Conducting a reverse-image search , we found that the first version appeared on April 27, posted by the user @schizarella . The bio claims the user is an \"investigative journalist\" who worked at the Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. But this isn't true — The New York Times released a statement explaining the X user had never worked at the newspaper back in January 2024. Between the fact that the image originated with a user who falsely uses large media outlets for credibility, and that Snopes could find no evidence this post existed, we strongly believe the screenshot is fake. This is not the first time someone falsely has connected Musk with robotic women — Snopes fact-checked an AI-generated image of Musk with a \"robot wife\" back in May 2023.",

Rating: Fake About this rating On May 14, 2024, a Reddit user posted a close-up photo seemingly showing X owner Elon Musk cuddling and rubbing noses with Meta owner Mark Zuckerberg. The Reddit user said the image needed investigating as they were confused about whether it was generated using artificial intelligence: Is this photo AI? I've heard people say it is, I've heard people say it's from way back in 2019, and I don't know what to believe. I think the crew needs to do an entire investigation on this photograph. X users made comparable comments, with one saying it was real and another writing : \"I don't think this is AI generated.\" Similar posts appeared elsewhere on Reddit , TikTok and Instagram , as well as on LinkedIn and Facebook in January 2024. Together, they had amassed more than 4.2 million interactions at the time of this writing. However, Snopes put the picture through two AI-image detectors and both showed an extremely high likelihood of the photo being created using AI, which is why we have rated the image as \"Fake.\" The picture was also clearly not real. If it was, reputable media outlets would have likely written news articles about it, but Snopes found no evidence of such reports. (umm-maybe AI image detector) Snopes could not determine the source of the photo; however, the earliest iteration we found on social media was in a collection of similar AI-generated images of the billionaire pair canoodling on Facebook that was posted on Jan. 5, 2024. (Is It AI?) Another X user , whose post had amassed more than 7.9 million views at the time of this writing, also stated the image was AI-generated. \"If we make enough pictures like this, AI generated images will certainly be banned from the platform,\" they wrote.",

He never posted, \"I am a pedophile.\" The screenshot is fake. As expected, no such post exists in Musk's feed. Also, a \"Follow\" button appears to the right of Musk's name on the fake post, but on Musk's real posts a \"Subscribe\" button appears. Furthermore, there is a discrepancy between the typefaces. The dot on the lowercase letter \"i\" in \"pedophile\" and the two periods in the fake post are both square-shaped, while the ones in the real posts above the fake one were round. The end of the word \"pedophile\" shows square-shaped dots above the \"i\" and for the period in the fake Musk post (left), while the genuine X posts have round dots (right).

    "article_text": "Claim: SpaceX CEO Elon Musk donated Starlink terminals to Ukraine following the Russian invasion in February 2022. Rating: True About this rating Starlink systems arrived in Ukraine less than a week after Russia invaded the neighboring nation in February 2022. The move came after Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's vice prime minister, took to Twitter on Feb. 26 — two days after the invasion — to ask SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to provide the novel satellite telecommunications system to the nation. That same day, Musk announced on Twitter that the satellite internet service was \"now active in Ukraine\" with more terminals en route.\" Two days later on Feb. 28, Fedorov posted a photo to the social media platform that displayed more than a dozen black boxes in what appeared to be a military type vehicle: Starlink offers high-speed broadband access through a constellation of satellites in low Earth orbit that, if all goes according to Musk's plan, will one day provide coverage anywhere on the planet, primarily in underserved areas and remote locations. The request by Federov came after internet outages were reported in Ukraine, and Russian government officials told its media to only publish information from official Russian sources . It was not clear where the Starlink systems were sent or what they would be used for, but as the BBC pointed out, the telecommunications system is likely to be used by the government, particularly as internet access is expected to get more difficult amid the ongoing war. Snopes contacted a representative with SpaceX to for further information about what the terminals would be used for, but did not receive a response as of this writing. We will update the article accordingly if we hear back. Although access to the internet has been dubbed by many a basic human right , the use of satellite systems during a conflict could pose more danger than safety. As researcher John Scott-Railton of The Citizen Lab , an academic research lab focused on digital threats, pointed out in a Feb. 26 Twitter thread , \"Russia has decades of experience hitting people by targeting their satellite communications.\" Satellite communications systems send signals in all directions so as to reach the satellite with which they are trying to communicate through, making them easy targets for enemies. In 1996, for example, Chechen president Dzhokhar Dudayev was killed by way of a Russian missile strike after Russian aircraft reportedly found the signal from his satellite phone. \"Takeaway: early in a conflict w/disrupted internet, satellite internet feels like a savior. But it quickly introduces *very real, deadly new vulnerabilities,*\" wrote Scott-Railton. \"If you don't understand them, people die needlessly until they learn & adapt. This has happened again. And again.\" It's not the first time Musk has deployed Starlink for a humanitarian cause. In January, the SpaceX company sent 50 terminals to Tonga after a volcanic eruption and tsunami rocked the island nation in January, reported Reuters . On March 9, Fedorov announced on Twitter that a second shipment of Starlink stations had been delivered to Ukraine. In a comment, Musk said that his company had also sent \"power adapters for cigarette lighters, solar/battery packs and generators for places where electricity is not available.\" Want to help break down misinformation on the internet?

After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.” Rating: Correct Attribution About this rating Context Musk provided no more details about this plan, including the timeline, how much power the new CEO would have, and whether he would actually abide by his statement. On Dec. 20, 2022, Twitter owner and CEO Elon Musk announced that he would step down as CEO after finding someone \"foolish enough to take the job.\" He made this announcement after tweeting out a poll on Dec. 18 in which he asked Twitter users if he should step down from the role, adding he would \"abide by the results of this poll.\" Some 57.5% of people who voted requested he step down. Musk made the announcement amid massive backlash to his decision to suspend a number of journalists from the platform (they were reinstated soon after), and after he laid off a majority of the company's staff. Meanwhile, Tesla stock plunged , and critics argued Musk's Twitter drama was serving as a major distraction from his other duties as Tesla's CEO. Many speculated Musk was making the announcements to placate Tesla shareholders. Musk did not give a timeline for when he would be replaced, nor was it clear that he would follow through on the promise. However, unnamed sources told CNBC that he had been actively looking for a replacement even before the Twitter poll. It was also unclear if Musk would actually give up power to a new CEO, since Musk would still have direct control over the company. Twitter is mostly made up of \"software & servers,\" The Verge noted , the area Musk said he would focus on when he was no longer CEO. While Musk claimed he will be stepping away from his role as CEO, there were no details about when he would do so, how much he would cede control of the company, and who his replacement would be. In short, while we rate his announcement as \"Correct Attribution\" — he actually said it — much remained unclear at the time of this reporting.

    "article_text": "Claim: In June 2024, Elon Musk announced the \"Tesla Phone,\" a new smartphone to compete with Apple's iPhone. Rating: Labeled Satire About this rating On June 10, 2024, SpaceXMania.com published an article claiming that the tech billionaire Elon Musk would be expanding one of his companies into a new market: smartphones. According to the story, Musk announced that the new phone would completely outperform Apple's iPhone and that the company, which he supposedly called \"Woke Apple,\" was in for a load of trouble. The story began as follows: Breaking: Elon Musk To Launch His Own New Phone To Compete With Apple, \"Woke Apple Is Finished\" In a bold move that could potentially reshape the landscape of the tech industry, Elon Musk has announced plans to launch his own smartphone, directly competing with tech giant Apple. Musk, the visionary CEO of companies like Tesla and SpaceX, declared that his new device would eclipse Apple's products, accompanied by the provocative statement, \"Woke Apple is finished.\" The story was also shared to a Facebook page associated with SpaceXMania.com, currently called \"The Patriots Lovers.\" However, frequent Snopes readers may recognize this page by a different name: SpaceX Lovers. In fact, despite the fact that the page's name on Facebook is \"The Patriots Lovers,\" the page's banner and profile image still use the \"SpaceX Lovers\" name. Those same frequent Snopes readers may know something else about the SpaceX Lovers Facebook page too: It is a \"satire\" page. As such, the story was not a factual recounting of real-life events. SpaceXMania.com features a disclaimer page with more information, and the Facebook post's caption included the word satire at the very end: Please note that the article under the category \"SATIRE\" are satirical in nature and are not meant to be taken seriously. These articles are meant to be humorous and are often entirely made up. We make no claim that the information presented in these articles is true or accurate. Readers should exercise caution and use their own judgment when reading and interpreting our satirical articles. We take no responsibility for any actions taken based on the content of these articles. One potential origin for the story may have been from Apple's 2024 Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) , when the company announced a partnership with OpenAI, which runs the ChatGPT language models. Apple announced that its tech would have a deep level of integration with OpenAI , a fact that Musk publicly criticized on his social media platform X. In the replies, users suggested that Musk develop his own smartphone, with one user providing a mock-up for the \" Tesla Phone ,\" the exact same name proposed in the satire article. Interestingly, Musk responded to another user who made a mock-up of a Samsung \"X Phone,\" calling the idea \" not out of the question .\" For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor.",

    "article_text": "Claim: On April 25, 2022, Elon Musk tweeted: “I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.” Rating: Correct Attribution About this rating On Dec. 15, 2022, Twitter banned the accounts of several prominent journalists from CNN, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and other news media outlets, after Musk accused them of violating Twitter's new policy against \"doxxing\" by sharing data showing Musk's live location (doxxing refers to the release of private information online about individuals). These bans were roundly criticized and even resulted in a threat of sanctions from the European Union for violating a respect for media freedoms. Some suggested that in suspending these journalists, Musk had gone back on his own word regarding free speech, when he tweeted in April 2022, \"I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.\" The tweet is archived here , and is still up on his account: In the case of the suspended journalists, Musk argued that he was simply enforcing the doxxing policy, which he said had been violated, compromising the security of himself and his family. He wrote on Twitter, soon after the suspensions: \"Criticizing me all day long is totally fine, but doxxing my real-time location and endangering my family is not,\" and said this rule applies to journalists the same way it does to everyone else. Musk claimed that a number of journalists had shared his live location, which he described as \"assassination coordinates.\" But numerous commentators argued that in at least some cases he was targeting journalists who had been critical of him in past reporting. The nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists said , \"If confirmed as retaliation for their work, this would be a serious violation of journalists' right to report the news without fear of reprisal.\" The suspensions highlighted a conflict between privacy and free speech. The location of Musk's private jet had been shared by the account @ElonJet, which was using publicly available flight data, which remain online and accessible to anyone, to track the movements of Musk's jet. Twitter permanently suspended the @Elonjet account, and Musk vowed to sue its owner as well as \"organizations who supported harm to my family.\" A number of the journalists who were suspended had written about this account and the kind of information it published. However Mashable's Matt Binder, said he had no idea why he was banned, as he never shared a hyperlink to the jet tracker. \"Clearly the people who were suspended were handpicked, because there are literally hundreds of accounts per minute who tweeted the link,\" Binder told the BBC. \"I did not share any location data, as per Twitter's new terms. Nor did I share any links to ElonJet or other location tracking accounts,\" Mr. Binder said in an email to the Christian Science Monitor . \"I have been highly critical of Mr. Musk but never broke any of Twitter's listed policies.\" Another of the suspended accounts was that of Washington Post reporter Drew Harwell, who said on social media platform Mastodon that he had posted links to \"publicly available, legally acquired data. \"Twitter's actions therefore appeared to conflict with what Musk had tweeted about free speech just a few months earlier, after he acquired ownership of Twitter. Musk subsequently tweeted a poll asking if the accounts should be unsuspended immediately or in seven days, suggesting that the suspension was intended to be temporary. The move to ban @ElonJet also contradicts a November tweet in which Musk pledged not to ban an unnamed flight tracking account even though it involved personal risk: By Dec. 16, 2022, several of the suspended journalist's accounts had been reinstated . As they began tweeting again, on Dec. 17, 2022, Washington Post technology columnist Taylor Lorenz found her account had been briefly suspended as she sought comment from Musk about an alleged stalking incident. By the next day her account appeared to be back . Musk has described himself as a free speech absolutist in the past, and his older tweets reflect that. As such we rate this claim as a \"Correct Attribution.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk is shifting X’s headquarters from Silicon Valley in California to Texas, saying, “I’d rather eat dirt than live in ‘woke’ California.” Rating: Labeled Satire About this rating On Dec. 3, 2023, a Facebook post shared an article from SpaceXMania claiming that Elon Musk was shifting the headquarters of X (formerly Twitter) from Silicon Valley in California to Texas, saying, “I’d rather eat dirt than live in ‘woke’ California.” The article , published a month before on Nov. 2, 2023, stated that his decision to move his company was part of a broader debate about California’s “woke” culture and progressive politics, as well as Texas' \"favorable\" tax environment: Musk’s recent clash with Twitter over freedom of speech and content moderation played a pivotal role in this decision. Musk’s views on free speech have put him at odds with social media platforms, which are headquartered in California. By moving X Corp to Texas, he aims to distance himself from the perceived “woke” culture in Silicon Valley and regain control over the platform’s policies. The term “woke” has been at the center of numerous debates in recent years. It is often used to describe a heightened awareness of social and political issues, particularly in the realms of racial and social justice. Critics argue that this culture can sometimes lead to excessive political correctness and censorship, stifling open dialogue and freedom of expression. Musk’s decision to relocate X Corp to Texas is, in part, a response to this culture. [...] Austin and the broader Texas area have become attractive destinations for tech talent. As a result, X Corp is likely to have access to a pool of skilled professionals who can contribute to the development of its super app concept. X Corp will also need to adapt to Texas’s regulatory environment, which differs from California’s. This transition may require adjustments in the company’s policies and practices, including those related to privacy, labor laws, and more. This article was presented as a work of satire and originated from a website that describes its content as such. A small number of online commentators assumed the story was real, nonetheless. One comment on the Facebook post read, “Great decision!” We have frequently covered stories from SpaceXMania, which describes itself as \"a team of writers and editors based in New York, USA\" with the mission \"to bring you the freshest fake news, some sassy analysis, and a good dose of satire, all rolled into one crazy concoction that orbits around Elon Musk and everything that’s lighting up the viral/trending charts.\" The website's About Us section states: Now, let’s talk about our digital lair – it’s not just a website; it’s a happening spot on social media where we hang out, shoot the breeze with you, spill the tea on breaking news, and flaunt our latest satirical masterpieces.

    "article_text": "Claim: If you sign up for Equifax's credit-monitoring service, you cannot join any class-action lawsuit against the company. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True The terms of service for Equifax's credit monitoring service, TrustedID Premier, say that users give up their right to participate in a class-action lawsuit or arbitration. What's False Those who user TrustedID Premier do not give up their right to participate in a class-action lawsuit or arbitration against Equifax over the 2017 data breach. After the credit-reporting company Equifax revealed on 7 September 2017 that a cyber-attack had exposed personal data for 143 million U.S. residents, the company promoted its service TrustedID Premier as a way for people to see if their information was stolen in the 29 July 2017 data breach. But critics highlighted a clause in TrustedID's terms that required people enrolling in the service to forfeit their right \"to bring or participate in a class action, class arbitration, or other representative action\": This arbitration will be conducted as an individual arbitration. Neither You nor We consent or agree to any arbitration on a class or representative basis, and the arbitrator shall have no authority to proceed with arbitration on a class or representative basis. No arbitration will be consolidated with any other arbitration proceeding without the consent of all parties. This class action waiver provision applies to and includes any Claims made and remedies sought as part of any class action, private attorney general action, or other representative action. By consenting to submit Your Claims to arbitration, You will be forfeiting Your right to bring or participate in any class action (whether as a named plaintiff or a class member) or to share in any class action awards, including class claims where a class has not yet been certified, even if the facts and circumstances upon which the Claims are based already occurred or existed. As of 8 September 2017, Equifax created a website, web site, EquifaxSecurity2017.com, addressing concerns over the issue, which stated that the cyber attack is not covered by TrustedID Premier's arbitration clause: Do the TrustedID Terms of Use limit my options related to the cyber security incident? The arbitration clause and class action wavier included in the TrustedID Premier Terms of Use applies to the free credit file monitoring and identity theft protection products, and not the cybersecurity incident. New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, whose office is investigating the data breach, said on Twitter that Equifax posted the statement \"after conversations [with his] office.\" We contacted Schneiderman's office seeking further comment but have yet to hear back. Equifax sent us a statement saying: In response to consumer inquiries, we have made it clear that the arbitration clause and class action waiver included in the Equifax and TrustedID Premier terms of use does not apply to this cybersecurity incident. However, other users have said that TrustedID's tool told them their data \"may have been impacted\" if they entered \"test\" as their last name and \"123456\" as the last six digits of their social security number. We entered the same number and \"Smith\" as a last name and got the same result. We contacted Equifax seeking comment but have not received a response. The company was also criticized following reports that a trio of executives -- Chief Financial Officer John Gamble, U.S. Information Solutions President Joseph Loughran and Workforce Solutions President Rodolfo Ploder -- sold a combined $2 million in company stock on 1 August and 2 August 2017. Equifax said that the three officials were unaware of the data breach at the time they sold their stock. The company announced on 26 September 2017 that chief executive officer Richard Smith would resign from both that position and his role as the chairman of the company's board. Paulino do Rego Barros Jr. was appointed as interim CEO, while another board member, Mark Feidler, will serve as \"non-executive chairman.\" As of 27 September 2017, Smith was scheduled to testify before the Senate Banking Committee at a hearing concerning the data breach.",

    "claim": "In summer 2021, Facebook started warning some users they may have seen &quot;harmful extremist content,&quot; and asking some users whether they were worried about friends becoming extremists.",
    "rating": "True",
    "article_text": "Claim: In summer 2021, Facebook started warning some users they may have seen \"harmful extremist content,\" and asking some users whether they were worried about friends becoming extremists. Rating: True About this rating In July 2021, some Facebook users reported seeing new warning messages from site administrators about \"harmful extremist content\" or asking whether they felt someone they knew was \"becoming an extremist.\" The reports authentically captured a new Facebook-led pilot initiative that attempted to help site administrators identify users or content that breached Facebook's existing bans on \" objectionable content .\" For that reason, we rate this claim \"True.\" According to reputable news outlets , the new messages were appearing for some users when they used the desktop or mobile version of Facebook. One notice took the form of a question, \"Are you concerned that someone you know is becoming an extremist?\" while the other warned, \"you may have been exposed to harmful extremist content recently.\" Another alert read, according to CNN: \"Violent groups try to manipulate your anger and disappointment. [...] You can take action now to protect yourself and others.\" Reuters reported : Facebook said the small test, which is only on its main platform, was running in the United States as a pilot for a global approach to prevent radicalization on the site. 'This test is part of our larger work to assess ways to provide resources and support to people on Facebook who may have engaged with or were exposed to extremist content, or may know someone who is at risk,' said a Facebook spokesperson in an emailed statement. \"We are partnering with NGOs [non-governmental organizations] and academic experts in this space and hope to have more to share in the future.' We reached out to the tech giant's communication team ourselves to discuss the notices, but we have not yet received a response. We will update this report, when, or if, that changes. All messages gave recipients the option to \"get support\" from one or more Facebook partners. A Facebook spokesperson told CNN they included Life After Hate , an advocacy group that helps people leave violent far-right movements. According to Reuters, the effort was part of Facebook's promise to counter extremist content after a user live-streamed himself opening fire at a New Zealand mosque — killing 51 people — in March 2019 . Andy Stone, a spokesperson for Facebook, confirmed the factualness of CNN's article about the news messages with the below-displayed tweet . Ultimately, the new warnings were a response to critics who believe the tech giant could have done more to prevent users from circulating false claims during the 2020 election and planning violence like the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. In March, for example, Avaaz , a nonprofit that seeks to curb misinformation, uncovered at least 267 pages or groups with connections to that it said spread violence-glorifying content — some of which remained active despite Facebook's efforts to block users from such material . Snopes has also identified such groups that have seemingly evaded the site's attempts to ban violent rhetoric, including a militia group in which users discussed plans to open fire on \"any one that starts rioting\" after the police shooting of a Black man, Jacob Blake , in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

    "article_text": "Claim: The CBS News TV show \"60 Minutes\" advised viewers to copy and paste a legal notice on Facebook that forbids Meta from using their personal data and photos. Rating: False About this rating Context Neither CBS News nor \"60 Minutes\" ever issued any such guidance. Further, a Facebook post is not a legal document. The act of copying and pasting a message on a user's Facebook feed does not alter a user's agreement of the company's terms, privacy policy and cookie policy. A rumor was circulating online in early 2025 saying that the CBS News TV program \"60 Minutes\" advised viewers to copy and paste a supposed legal notice on their Facebook feeds. According to the Facebook users who shared the message, reposting the text officially informed Meta — Facebook's parent company — not to use their personal data or photos for any unauthorized purposes. One Snopes reader asked if the rumor was true or false. One Facebook user's copied-and-pasted post ( archived ) from Jan. 7 read as follows: According to the show 60 Minutes: Just in case you missed it: a lawyer advised us to post this. The violation of privacy can be punished by law NOTE: Facebook Meta is now a public entity. Every member must post a note like this. If you do not publish a statement at least once, it will be technically understood that you are allowing the use of your photos, as well as the information contained in your profile status updates. I HEREBY DECLARE THAT I DO NOT GIVE MY PERMISSION FOR FACEBOOK OR META TO USE ANY OF MY PERSONAL DATA. DO NOT USE ANY OF MY PERSONAL DATA. Numerous users shared similar messages , all claiming that \"60 Minutes\" issued an advisory or some sort of guidance. However, this rumor was false. A search of CBSNews.com produced no information advising viewers to post a message on Facebook about the usage of their personal data and photos . Also, Meta did not publish any company news about plans to do something new and unwanted with users' data and photos . Further, posting such a message in no way constitutes a legal notice to Meta, as users already agreed to the company's terms, privacy policy and cookies policy when they initially signed up for their accounts. Snopes contacted CBS News for comment and will update this article if they reply. A Long-Running Hoax The language Facebook \"is now a public entity\" was one clue that the posts featured an old rumor. Facebook held its initial public offering (IPO) on the stock market in 2012. Snopes has reported on numerous variations of this same rumor since that year. The copied-and-pasted posts are part of a long-running hoax. For further reading, we previously compiled a list of rumors involving Facebook \"copypasta\" — internet slang combining the words \"copy\" and \"paste.\"",

Rating: False About this rating In September 2023, Facebook users shared a message that claimed the social media platform would soon be charging users $7.99 per month — that apparently being the only way users could continue to access the company's app and website. The posts also said that the supposedly bombshell tech news was reported by \"Channel 13 News.\" . A commonly shared version of the copy-and-paste post (\" copypasta ,\" in short) read as follows: Since the $7.99 charge is coming, I do not give permission to Facebook to charge $7.99 a month to my account, also, all of my pictures are property of myself and not Facebook! So now they are doing it, we just saw on Channel 13 News, that Facebook will be charging all users starting Monday. You can do an \"opt-out\" by posting the above. Hold your fingers over and copy. Bye Bye ads Yessssss it works!!! Just in case However, Facebook did not make any announcements about charging users in order to use its services: not $4.99, as we previously reported , not $7.99, nor any other amount of money. Also, no organization named \"Channel 13 News\" reported this rumor to be true. The inclusion of this news station with the channel number \"13\" is something that we previously noted had been going around for many years. As Facebook once stated , the website's services are made possible by advertising revenue: No, we don't charge you to use Facebook. Instead, we charge advertisers to show ads on Meta Company Products. This helps us make Facebook available to everyone without charging people for access to it. Meta previously announced in February 2023 that it had plans to charge some users who wished to have their accounts verified with a badge. However, we found no information that would indicate Facebook would soon begin charging users to access its ordinary services. Further, a block of legalese copied and pasted into a Facebook post isn't really an official, valid, declaration of anything. As Jerry Seinfeld once said to Cosmo Kramer on \"Seinfeld,\" \"Well, I don't know if what you have here constitutes a legally-binding document.\"",

Rating: False About this rating For years, messages about protecting your copyright or privacy rights on Facebook by posting a particular legal notice to your account on the social media platform have spread across the internet. Most of these messages have shared as copypasta — copied-and-pasted text often used to pass along an alleged warning of some sort. We found the latest variation of this claim began to pick up steam on Facebook in May 2024, mentioning Meta, the social media company's parent company: Goodbye Metaverse, it's been a Nightmare. Just in case Notice: An attorney advised us to post this. The violation of privacy can be punished by law. NOTE: Facebook Meta is now a public entity. All members must post a note like this.

Good bye annoying ads and Hello new and old friends! The text — which mentioned how an attorney had advised the user on the notice, as well as that every person on Facebook needed to post the notice or else they were allowing their photos or information to be used by the social media platform — was reminiscent of previous posts we've seen on the platform. We previously fact-checked this type of claims in 2012 . We also looked into similar claims related to Snapchat photos in 2019 and a \"new Facebook/Meta rule\" in 2021 . In all of these cases, as with the latest one in 2024, we found the claims to be false. The \"problem\" the notice supposedly solves doesn't exist. Facebook users can't retroactively negate the privacy or copyright terms they agreed to when they signed up. They also can't alter or contradict any new privacy or copyright terms instituted by Facebook simply by posting a contrary legal notice on their account. We've fact-checked other claims about Facebook policy, including a false claim that the company allowed an \"unprecedented\" Facebook rule to take effect that would allow users to do what they wanted with users' photos.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Concerned artificial intelligence researchers hurriedly abandoned an experimental chatbot program after they realized that the bots were inventing their own language. Rating: False About this rating It is probably not a coincidence that two of the top-trending news stories of July 2017 were, in the first case, a warning from billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk that artificial intelligence (AI) poses an \"existential threat\" to human civilization, and, in the second case, the announcement that an AI experiment sponsored by Facebook was, according to some sources, \"shut down\" after researchers discovered that the chatbots they programmed had begun communicating with one another in a private language of their own invention. Musk, who has previously warned that the development of autonomous weaponry could lead to an \"AI arms race\", told the National Governors Association on 15 July 2017 that the risks posed by artificial intelligence are so great that it needs to be proactively regulated before it's too late. \"Once there is awareness,\" Musk said, \"people will be extremely afraid, as they should be.\" Whether he meant it to or not, in some people's minds Musk's warning conjured up images of Skynet , the fictional AI network in the Terminator film series that became self-aware and set out to destroy the human race in the interests of self-preservation. Cue the \"creepy chatbot\" stories. Albeit prompted by a somewhat dry 14 June blog post by Facebook's Artificial Intelligence Research team ( FAIR ) describing an inroad in the development of dialog agents (AI systems designed to communicate with humans), the news that chatbots were found to be communicating with each other via a private language received more and more sensationalized treatment in the press as the summer wore on. In a report published the day before Musk gave his speech to the governors, Fast Co. Design delivered a fascinating account of the FAIR team's experiment with nary a hint of dystopian fear-mongering: Bob: \"I can can I I everything else.\" Alice: \"Balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to.\" To you and I, that passage looks like nonsense. But what if I told you this nonsense was the discussion of what might be the most sophisticated negotiation software on the planet? Negotiation software that had learned, and evolved, to get the best deal possible with more speed and efficiency — and perhaps, hidden nuance — than you or I ever could? Because it is. This conversation occurred between two AI agents developed inside Facebook. At first, they were speaking to each other in plain old English. But then researchers realized they'd made a mistake in programming. \"There was no reward to sticking to English language,\" says Dhruv Batra, visiting research scientist from Georgia Tech at Facebook AI Research (FAIR). As these two agents competed to get the best deal — a very effective bit of AI vs. AI dogfighting researchers have dubbed a \"generative adversarial network\" — neither was offered any sort of incentive for speaking as a normal person would. So they began to diverge, eventually rearranging legible words into seemingly nonsensical sentences. The key word is \"seemingly,\" for in this instance the agents' neologisms were simple, straightforward, and easily decipherable: \"Agents will drift off understandable language and invent codewords for themselves,\" says Batra, speaking to a now-predictable phenomenon that's been observed again, and again, and again. \"Like if I say 'the' five times, you interpret that to mean I want five copies of this item. This isn't so different from the way communities of humans create shorthands.\" The article notes that the researchers chose not to let the bots continue developing a private language in favor of programming them to stick to plain English, given that the whole point of the research is to improve AI-to-human communication. That decision took on a more and more sinister vibe as more and more venues reported the story, however, as exemplified in this small sampling of the dozens of blurbs shared via social media: Among other misrepresentations, some articles claimed that the scientists were \"shocked\" or \"surprised\" when the chatbots invented new forms of expression. Not so, the study's lead author, Michael Lewis, told us via e-mail: We gave some AI systems a goal to achieve, which required them to communicate with each other. While they were initially trained to communicate in English, in some initial experiments we only reward them for achieving their goal, not for using good English. This meant that after thousands of conversations with each other, they started using words in ways that people wouldn't. In some sense, they had a simple language that they could use to communicate with each other, but was hard for people to understand. This was not important or particularly surprising, and in future experiments we used some established techniques to reward them for using English correctly. There have also been a number of papers from other research groups on methods for making AIs invent simple languages from scratch. As to the claim that the project was \"shut down\" because the bots' deviation from English caused concern, Lewis said that, too, misrepresents the facts: There was no panic, and the project hasn't been shut down. Our goal was to build bots that could communicate with people. In some experiments, we found that they weren't using English words as people do — so we stopped those experiments, and used some additional techniques to get the bots to work as we wanted. Analyzing the reward function and changing the parameters of an experiment is NOT the same as \"unplugging\" or \"shutting down AI.\" If that were the case, every AI researcher has been \"shutting down AI\" every time they stop a job on a machine. The main thing lost in all the hubbub about dialog agents inventing their own language, Lewis said, is that the study produced significant results in terms of its core mission: training bots to negotiate with people, a task that requires both linguistic and reasoning skills: We introduced a new technique for having bots simulate possible future conversations before deciding what to say (\"If I say this, you might say that, then I'll say this\"), and found that this significantly improved their ability on the negotiation task. We asked, finally, if Lewis and his colleagues see anything inherently dangerous in letting AI systems develop their own languages. He said no. \"While it is often the case that modern AI systems solve problems in ways that are hard for people to interpret, they are always trying to achieve the goals that were given to them by people.\" William Wisher, who wrote the Terminator films (among others) and who was part of a panel about artificial intelligence and its future at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, weighed in on the Skynet scenario, telling us: Right now, everyone is terrified of AI and project nightmarish scenarios around it, assuming that we are creating our own new overlords. I've been part of that in the Terminator films. It makes for a good movie. But what everyone fails to appreciate in these fever dreams is that human beings are the most adaptable, clever, and aggressive predators in the known universe. That really helps me sleep at night. Because I don't believe AI will ever fully develop as a separate thing from people. I don't think we'd allow it to. We are in infant stages now, but I think we will subsume AI and make it part of ourselves; better to control it. Implanting neural nets, within our brains that are connected to it, etc. Now that raises all kinds of as yet unseen \"have and have not\" issues. But that's another subject for another time.",

    "article_text": "Claim: In February 2021, Facebook banned its own page while implementing an initiative to ban all news publications on its Australian platform. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True Facebook's page in Australia appeared to be banned following its announcement that it would be banning news publications on its Australia platform. What's Undetermined As of this writing, it remains unclear whether Facebook's banning its own page was related to the general ban on news, and whether Facebook has reinstated that page. A Facebook spokesperson told an Australian news outlet that non-news page bans were mistakes and would be reversed. In what appeared to be a botched effort to ban news sites on its platform in Australia, Facebook appeared to ban its own page — along with a number of pages for government agencies, health services, and charitable organizations. In February 2021, Facebook banned news on its platform in Australia in response to a proposed law working its way through the Australian government that would require technology platforms such as Facebook and Google to pay news sources for content. Google has chosen to negotiate and strike deals to pay news agencies. But Facebook stated that \"with a heavy heart,\" it was instead choosing to ban news, stating : This discussion has focused on US technology companies and how they benefit from news content on their services. We understand many will ask why the platforms may respond differently. The answer is because our platforms have fundamentally different relationships with news. Google Search is inextricably intertwined with news and publishers do not voluntarily provide their content. On the other hand, publishers willingly choose to post news on Facebook, as it allows them to sell more subscriptions, grow their audiences and increase advertising revenue. It appears that in so doing, Facebook caught a number of non-news pages up in the ban, including its own page. The ban only affected pages for Facebook users in Australia, however — these changes wouldn't have been visible to audiences on other continents. But Josh Taylor, a journalist for Guardian Australia , captured a screenshot: Facebook's own page wasn't the only one that was affected by the broad ban in Australia. As The New York Times reported, government agencies and various public welfare organizations were also banned: And then Australians discovered it wasn’t just those staples that were missing. Pages for state health departments and emergency services were also wiped clean. The Bureau of Meteorology, providing weather data in the middle of fire season — blank. An opposition candidate running for office in Western Australia, just a few weeks from an election — every message, gone . Even pages for nonprofits providing information to domestic violence victims fell into the Facebook dragnet, along with those for organizations that work with the poor and vulnerable. We reached out to Facebook asking whether the problem would be resolved, but as of this writing, we haven't received a response. Guardian Australia reported that a Facebook spokesperson said the banning of non-news pages was a mistake: A Facebook spokeswoman said the blocks on non-news organisations had been a mistake. “The actions we’re taking are focused on restricting publishers and people in Australia from sharing or viewing Australian and international news content,” she said. “As the law does not provide clear guidance on the definition of news content, we have taken a broad definition in order to respect the law as drafted. However, we will reverse any pages that are inadvertently impacted.”",

    "article_text": "Claim: A video with an \"ONN\" logo describes Facebook as a surveillance program for the CIA and says that Mark Zuckerberg is one of its agents. Rating: Originated as Satire About this rating Fact Check On May 2, 2022, we received reader mail that referred to a newly posted TikTok video that showed a recording on a TV. According to the video , Facebook is a surveillance program for the CIA and Mark Zuckerberg is secretly one of its agents. Some readers might already be able to tell this is fake, but still might be interested in knowing how this all started. According to Google Trends , some Google users were searching for answers about Facebook , Zuckerberg , and the CIA in the hours and days after the video was posted to TikTok. In the bottom-right corner of the video are the letters, \"ONN.\" This stood for \" The Onion News Network .\" This was likely difficult to see since the vertical TikTok video showed a recording of a TV from a short distance. It was simply an old clip from a satirical TV show that was created by the well-known satire website, The Onion . The episode shown in the video first aired on March 18, 2011, making it more than 11 years old by the time it was posted to TikTok. TikTok user @bigdaddyleo1037 , who uploaded the video to the platform, provided hints that it was satire with the hashtags \"#onionnews\" and \"#comedy.\" The full \"FactZone\" segment with Brooke Alvarez, who was portrayed by actor Suzanne Sena , is available on YouTube : We transcribed the clip below: This is The Onion News Network. Better news. Better viewers. Brooke Alvarez: Congress today reauthorized funding for Facebook , the massive online surveillance program run by the CIA . According to Department of Homeland Security reports, Facebook has replaced almost every other CIA information gathering program since it was launched in 2004. Christopher Sartinsky: After years of secretly monitoring the public, we were astounded so many people would willingly publicize where they live, their religious and political views, an alphabetized list of all their friends' personal email addresses, phone numbers, hundreds of photos of themselves, and even status updates about what they were doing moment-to-moment. It is truly a dream come true for the CIA . Alvarez: Much of the credit belongs to CIA agent Mark Zuckerberg , who runs the day-to-day Facebook operations for the agency. The decorated agent, codenamed \"The Overlord,\" was recently awarded the prestigious medal of intelligence commendation for his work with the Facebook program, which he has called \"the single most powerful tool for population control ever created.\" Among the biggest successes of the Facebook program is Operation FarmVille, which the CIA credits with pacifying as many as 85 million people after unemployment rates rose dramatically. Other features, such as the suggested friends window, have been instrumental in allowing government agents to infiltrate deeper into the friend networks of suspected dissidents. During the segment, one of the other satirical moments included a graphic that read, \" CIA Calls Facebook 'Reason We Invented The Internet.'\" The satirical video from The Onion News Network also included a panel of three people called \"First Responders.\" One of the questions they answered was about how the CIA also purportedly created Twitter in what it called the \"Twitter Initiative.\" One of the panelists said that the program should be \"cut entirely.\" Another person followed up with, \"Right, 400 billion tweets and not one useful bit of data was ever transmitted.\" Later, Alvarez cited a report that found Al-Qaida created Foursquare \"to identify popular locations for bombing.\" A panelist answered, \"Actually Brooke, that's been discredited as any kind of real threat. The people that use that site are people that no one would mind seeing bombed anyway.\" In sum, the video about Facebook , Zuckerberg , and the CIA all originated as satire from the old TV show, \" The Onion News Network.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: More than half a billion Facebook users had some personal information leaked onto a hacker forum in April 2021. Rating: True About this rating On April 3, 2021, Business Insider reported that the personal information of more than half a billion Facebook users was dumped onto a hacking forum: The exposed data includes the personal information of over 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries, including over 32 million records on users in the US, 11 million on users in the UK, and 6 million on users in India. It includes their phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, bios, and, in some cases, email addresses. Business Insider reported that the exposed data was posted in a \"low-level hacking forum\" on April 3. The data breach was indirectly confirmed by Facebook, which said in an April 6 blog post that the problem initially occurred in 2019 and has since been fixed: We believe the data in question was scraped from people’s Facebook profiles by malicious actors using our contact importer prior to September 2019. This feature was designed to help people easily find their friends to connect with on our services using their contact lists. When we became aware of how malicious actors were using this feature in 2019, we made changes to the contact importer. In this case, we updated it to prevent malicious actors from using software to imitate our app and upload a large set of phone numbers to see which ones matched Facebook users. Through the previous functionality, they were able to query a set of user profiles and obtain a limited set of information about those users included in their public profiles. The information did not include financial information, health information or passwords. We reached out to Facebook and asked whether the company would notify users affected by the breach, but didn't get a response in time for publication. We will update if we hear back. A Facebook spokesperson told Reuters , however, that it doesn't have plans to do so. In lieu of that, Facebook users can check the website Have I Been Pwned to see if their email addresses or phones have been part of that or other data breaches. As Wired reported , victims of the breaches included some notable figures, including Facebook cofounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and several high ranking government officials in the U.S. and Europe.",

    "claim": "Facebook has been kicking inactive users out of groups.",
    "rating": "Mostly True",
    "article_text": "Claim: Facebook has been kicking inactive users out of groups. Rating: Mostly True About this rating What's True Facebook users who were previously invited to a group and listed as a “member” were moved to an “invited” list if they had never interacted with the group, as a one-time change implemented by the platform. What's False Users can rejoin and stay in groups if they interact with the groups. In mid-January 2019, Facebook users began reporting that people were being kicked out of Facebook groups if they were not active in them. A message from a group administrator circulated as an example of this phenomenon. It read: Facebook has decided it wants to have some say in our groups. They have begun kicking people out who do not participate. This is not my choice and I am extremely upset about it. They put the booted people back in the invite list. So what I need you guys to do is respond to the post and participate in group as much as you can if you want to stay. Let's not let facebook dictate who we can and cannot have in this group. -Admin Sara We reached out to Facebook to see if this statement is accurate, and it is, although it may be a bit exaggerated to say Facebook is \"kicking people out.\" According to a Facebook spokesperson, the social media platform is moving inactive group members to an \"invited\" list pending further action from them or group administrators. The spokesperson told us in an emailed statement: \"We want to make sure that when people join a Facebook group, they are joining a community that is relevant and meaningful to them. Now, when someone is invited and approved by an admin or member, they will be able to preview the group first and have an option to accept or decline the invitation. Unless they accept the invite, they will not be shown as a member of the group.\" Per Facebook, that means group members who have never visited or interacted with posts in the group get moved to the \"invited\" list until they accept the group's invite. The invitation to the group will expire in 28 days if the user doesn't like a post in the group or accept the invitation. Although this could result in a reduction in the number of members a group has, administrators can attempt to recoup members by contacting people on the \"invited\" list once to ask them to accept. This is a course change from the previous practice, when Facebook users could be automatically added to groups by friends. Facebook implemented the change the week of 13 January 2019. In unrelated news also pertaining to Facebook groups, the company reported on 17 January 2019 that it removed \"multiple Pages, groups and accounts originating that engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior on Facebook and Instagram\" and were part of a disinformation campaign originating in Russia that targeted various countries: \"Today we removed 364 Facebook Pages and accounts for engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior as part of a network that originated in Russia and operated in the Baltics, Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Central and Eastern European countries. The Page administrators and account owners primarily represented themselves as independent news Pages or general interest Pages on topics like weather, travel, sports, economics, or politicians in Romania, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia, and Kyrgyzstan. Despite their misrepresentations of their identities, we found that these Pages and accounts were linked to employees of Sputnik, a news agency based in Moscow, and that some of the Pages frequently posted about topics like anti-NATO sentiment, protest movements, and anti-corruption.\"",

    "claim": "A Facebook post claims that typing the &quot;@&quot; symbol in a comment and then clicking the word &quot;highlight&quot; will reveal the friends and other users who view your profile the most.",
    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: A Facebook post claims that typing the \"@\" symbol in a comment and then clicking the word \"highlight\" will reveal the friends and other users who view your profile the most. Rating: False About this rating In late November 2023, we received reader mail that asked about a specific Facebook rumor. According to the emails, the rumor was about Facebook posts that claimed that typing an \"@\" symbol in a comment box, selecting the word \"highlight\" from a pop-up menu and then submitting the comment would allow a user to see which friends had been lurking on their profile or page more than anyone else. The gist of this rumor was that this supposed \"@\" and \"highlight\" method would produce a small list of Facebook friends, perhaps family members, close friends and maybe even anyone who was secretly and romantically attracted to the user. 'Type @ in the Comments' One version of this rumor was shared as follows: \"Type @ in the comments and then click highlight to see who’s always checking your profile. If it turns blue you got page watchers.\" It's Not Real However, here's the truth: This rumor is false. While users who post photos and videos to Facebook stories and Instagram stories truly are able to see who has viewed their content, there's no truth to the idea that there's a secret way to find out which users have specifically been looking at a Facebook profile. It's Also Not Possible As the social media company once noted on its own official help center website, \"Facebook doesn't let people track who views their profile.\" Also, third-party apps don't provide this functionality, either, according to the page. The Legitimate Reason @highlight Exists To test the \"@\" and \"highlight\" rumor, we chose a Facebook post (a scam post that falsely claimed investors on \"Shark Tank\" endorsed keto weight loss gummies) and simply typed out \"@highlight.\" Before posting the comment, a menu popped up that listed various Facebook pages that included the word \"highlight\" in them. Near the bottom of the list, \"@highlight\" was mentioned with the words, \"Some friends might receive notifications.\" Upon selecting the \"@highlight\" feature with the words about friends receiving notifications and then posting the comment, the \"@highlight\" text turned blue and turned into a link. Clicking on this link simply led to a Facebook page that displayed pending friend requests. The link did not display any current Facebook friends who might be repeatedly viewing a user's profile. (The URL that the \"@highlight\" link led to was facebook.com/find-friends/browser .) As for the \"@highlight\" comment feature itself, Distractify.com published in October 2023 that its legitimate purpose is to allow users \"to highlight a particular post by increasing its size and visibility.\" We reached out to Facebook for more details and will update this story if we receive a response. Why Some Users Shared the Rumor Aside from the innocent users who were sharing the viral posts because they believed the false rumor, the Rick's Daily Tips website reported that some profiles and pages were also spreading the \"hoax\" in order to boost engagement via likes, comments and shares. In theory, this strategy would potentially attract more users to help a profile or page grow with followers, perhaps making it valuable enough in the future to be sold to scammers. The original creator of the profile or page also might opt to use it to create malicious posts or ads that violate Meta's policies, writer Rick Rouse added. As a general rule, we don't recommend placing blind trust in viral copy-and-paste posts that describe supposed secrets of Facebook's functionality. Such dubious rumors have been spread for the nearly two decades of the social media platform's existence, such as the false claim that copying and pasting a specific block of text will help a user to remove ads and display more content from friends. These kinds of rumors simply aren't true. In the words of a woman in a years-old American TV ad that appeared to allude to Facebook's technology, \"That's not how it works. That's not how any of this works.\"",

    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: A Facebook post claims that typing the \"@\" symbol in a comment and then clicking the word \"highlight\" will reveal the friends and other users who view your profile the most. Rating: False About this rating In December 2023, Facebook users copied and pasted a notice that purportedly was about how to perform an interesting experiment. We also previously received reader mail that asked about the subject. According to the posts and emails, a rumor said that typing an \"@\" symbol in a comment box, selecting the word \"highlight\" from a pop-up menu and then submitting the comment would allow a user to see which friends had been lurking on their profile or page more than anyone else. The gist of this rumor was that this supposed \"@\" and \"highlight\" method would produce a small list of Facebook friends, perhaps family members, close friends and maybe even anyone who was secretly and romantically attracted to the user. 'Type @ in the Comments' One version of this rumor was shared as follows: \"Type @ in the comments and then click highlight to see who’s always checking your profile. If it turns blue you got page watchers.\" It's Not Real However, here's the truth: This rumor is false. While users who post photos and videos to Facebook stories and Instagram stories truly are able to see who has viewed their content, there's no truth to the idea that there's a secret way to find out which users have specifically been looking at a Facebook profile. It's Also Not Possible As the social media company once noted on its own official help center website, \"Facebook doesn't let people track who views their profile.\" Also, third-party apps don't provide this functionality, either, according to the page. The Legitimate Reason @highlight Exists To test the \"@\" and \"highlight\" rumor, we chose a Facebook post (a scam post that falsely claimed investors on \"Shark Tank\" endorsed keto weight loss gummies) and simply typed out \"@highlight.\" Before posting the comment, a menu popped up that listed various Facebook pages that included the word \"highlight\" in them. Near the bottom of the list, \"@highlight\" was mentioned with the words, \"Some friends might receive notifications.\" Upon selecting the \"@highlight\" feature with the words about friends receiving notifications and then posting the comment, the \"@highlight\" text turned blue and turned into a link. Clicking on this link simply led to a Facebook page that displayed pending friend requests. The link did not display any current Facebook friends who might be repeatedly viewing a user's profile. (The URL that the \"@highlight\" link led to was facebook.com/find-friends/browser .) As for the \"@highlight\" comment feature itself, Distractify.com published in October 2023 that its legitimate purpose is to allow users \"to highlight a particular post by increasing its size and visibility.\" We reached out to Facebook for more details and will update this story if we receive a response. Why Some Users Shared the Rumor Aside from the innocent users who were sharing the viral posts because they believed the false rumor, the Rick's Daily Tips website reported that some profiles and pages were also spreading the \"hoax\" in order to boost engagement via likes, comments and shares. In theory, this strategy would potentially attract more users to help a profile or page grow with followers, perhaps making it valuable enough in the future to be sold to scammers. The original creator of the profile or page also might opt to use it to create malicious posts or ads that violate Meta's policies, writer Rick Rouse added. As a general rule, we don't recommend placing blind trust in viral copy-and-paste posts that describe supposed secrets of Facebook's functionality. Such dubious rumors have been spread for the nearly two decades of the social media platform's existence, such as the false claim that copying and pasting a specific block of text will help a user to remove ads and display more content from friends. These kinds of rumors simply aren't true. In the words of a woman in a years-old American TV ad that appeared to allude to Facebook's technology, \"That's not how it works. That's not how any of this works.\"",

    "claim": "A new Facebook/Meta rule allows the company to use your photos without permission, and posting a legal notice on your page will prevent it from doing so.",
    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: A new Facebook/Meta rule allows the company to use your photos without permission, and posting a legal notice on your page will prevent it from doing so. Rating: False About this rating In November 2021, a copypasta post claiming that a new \"Facebook/Meta rule\" allows Facebook (lately renamed \"Meta\") to use members' photographs without their permission circulated widely on that platform. The post included a block of legalese citing supposed Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) statutes that allow users to impose a \"Reservation of Rights\" preventing Facebook and Meta from using or distributing such materials: The new Facebook/Meta rule starts tomorrow where they can use your photos. Don't forget the deadline is today! This could be used in lawsuits against you. Everything you've ever posted is posted today - even messages that have been deleted. It doesn't cost anything, just copy and post, better than regretting later. Under UCC Law Sections 1-207, 1-308... I am imposing my Reservation of Rights... I DO NOT ALLOW Facebook/Meta or any other Facebook/Meta related person to use my photos, information, messages or messages, both in the past and in the future. This statement I inform Facebook/Meta that it is strictly prohibited to disclose, copy, distribute or take any other action against me based on this account and / or its contents. This account content is private and confidential information. Violation of my personal life may be punished by law. NOTE: Facebook/Meta is now a public organization. All participants should post a note like this. If you prefer, you can copy and paste this version. If you don't publish a discharge at least once, you'll automatically allow the use of your photos, as well as the information contained in your account status updates. NOT ′′ share ′′ but ′′ copy + paste \"! Their new algorithm is chosen by the same people - about 25 who will read your posts. Consequently: Hold your finger anywhere in this post and a copy will appear. Click on Copy. Then go to your page, start a new post and place your finger in an empty field. ′′ Insert ′′ will appear and you will click on it. This will pass the system. I'm not giving Facebook/Meta permission to share my information posted on their website. PHOTOS, CURRENT or PAST, PUBLICATION, PHONE NUMBER OR POST... Absolutely nothing can be used in any form without my written permission. This was yet another variation of a familiar Facebook copypasta text , which we identified as false in June 2012. Learn more: What Is Copypasta? We rate the newer variation false as well, given that it is simply a slight rewrite of the older version and promulgates the same misinformation. Facebook (Meta) has not instituted or announced any \"new rule\" that changes the conditions under which it may use members' content. In its current (as of Nov. 15, 2021) Terms of Service statement , Facebook (Meta) notes that: The Facebook company is now Meta. While our company name is changing, we are continuing to offer the same products, including the Facebook app from Meta. Our Data Policy and Terms of Service remain in effect, and this name change does not affect how we use or share data. That same terms of service statement includes two important (though not new) declarations all users need be aware of. Essentially, although users own the intellectual property rights to the content they create and share, when they agree to the company's terms of service by using the service, and depending on their selection of privacy settings for their account, they also grant Facebook (Meta) a license to do certain things with that content: \"You own the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on Facebook and the other Facebook Company Products you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.\" \"Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings).\" As noted by an attorney and social media expert in a 2012 ABC News report we quoted in our previous coverage , posting a boilerplate legal notice on one's Facebook page is \"useless\": Brad Shear, a Washington-area attorney and blogger who is an expert on social media, said the message [that Facebook users are posting to their walls is] “misleading and not true.” He said that when you agree to Facebook’s terms of use you provide Facebook a “non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any content you post. You do not need to make any declarations about copyright issues since the law already protects you. The privacy declaration [in this message] is worthless and does not mean anything.” Have you seen other variations of this claim? Let us know.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Copying and pasting a \"OO5251839\" message \"circumvents\" Facebook's algorithm and makes old friends appear in your News Feed. Rating: False About this rating In May 2021, an old and false claim was resurrected about Facebook friends. It claimed that copying and pasting a message with the code \"OO5251839\" would show a Facebook user's posts to old friends. It would also purportedly allow users to see posts from friends that maybe hadn't appeared in their News Feeds for years. The purported Facebook code began with two letters: \"OO5251839.\" Some variations may have started with zeroes: \"005251839.\" Posts that soared in popularity in mid-2021 began with: \"Thanks for the tip to circumvent Facebook … OO5251839 Works!!\" Thanks for the tip to circumvent Facebook...OO5251839 Works!! I have a whole new profile. I see posts from people I didn't see anymore. Facebook's new algorithm picks the same people - around 25-who will see your posts. Hold your finger anywhere in this post and click \" copy \". Go to your page where it says \" what's on your mind\". Tap your finger anywhere in the empty field. Click paste. This is going to circumvent the system. Hello new and old friends! Hello Drop a single hello, thanks! PLEASE SAY HELLO IF YOU SEE THIS. Hello to all! However, this \"OO5251839\" message had no impact on the Facebook algorithm. 'It Worked for Me' Some Facebook users might have thought that the \"OO5251839\" message worked if they received comments under their posts. However, if this was the case, the explanation is simple. The copy-and-paste message asked friends to say \"hello.\" It would not be a huge surprise that some of the poster's friends saw the message and responded \"hello.\" It's also likely that the more comments a post received, the better it might rank in the News Feeds of friends. As more \"hello\" comments racked up, it's probably going to show to more friends. 'Tale as Old as Time' Copy-and-paste Facebook rumors have been circulating about as long as Facebook has been around. The \"OO5251839\" message was not the first time that Facebook users copied and pasted posts that were said to avoid or protect against unwanted aspects of the Facebook platform. For example, in the past we covered a false claim about \" copy and paste\" and \"don't share \" messages. We also reported about a dubious warning in regards to Facebook and Instagram purportedly making all posts public . In sum, the \"OO5251839\" Facebook message did not circumvent Facebook's algorithm or change anything about a user's Facebook friends.",

    "article_text": "Claim: User videos taken in November 2019 showed Facebook's mobile application inadvertently opening the phone's camera in the background. Rating: True About this rating In November 2019, some social media users reported their cameras were being opened in the background while they scrolled on the mobile Facebook application. One Twitter user, for instance, posted a video that supposedly showed the security/privacy issue: Found a @facebook #security & #privacy issue. When the app is open it actively uses the camera. I found a bug in the app that lets you see the camera open behind your feed. Note that I had the camera pointed at the carpet. pic.twitter.com/B8b9oE1nbl — Joshua Maddux (@JoshuaMaddux) November 10, 2019 Another person on Twitter also found that his phone's rear camera (the selfie lens) was opened when he browsed on the mobile app: Facebook app on iOS 13.2.2 opens my phone’s rear camera when I open a profile photo swipe down to return (look at the little slit on the left of the video). Is this an app bug or an iOS bug?? @facebook @AppleSupport pic.twitter.com/WlhSXZulqx — Daryl Lasafin (@dzlasafin) November 10, 2019 Several tech websites have since picked up on these tweets and have published reports on these privacy concerns. Here's a run-down of the issue from CNET : When you're scrolling through Facebook's app, the social network could be using your camera, concerned users have found. Multiple people have found and reported that their iPhone cameras were turned on in the background while they were looking at their feed. The issue came to light through several posts on Twitter. Users noted that their cameras were activated behind Facebook's app as they were watching videos or looking at photos on the social network. After people clicked on the video to full screen, returning it back to normal would create a bug in which Facebook's mobile layout was slightly shifted to the right. With the open space on the left, you could now see the phone's camera activated in the background. Guy Rosen, the vice president of integrity at Facebook, confirmed on Nov. 12, 2019, that there was indeed a bug on some versions of the Facebook iOS app that was causing the camera to inadvertently open. Rosen said Facebook found no evidence that any videos or photographs were uploaded due to this bug and said the company had submitted a fix to the app store: We recently discovered our iOS app incorrectly launched in landscape. In fixing that last week in v246 we inadvertently introduced a bug where the app partially navigates to the camera screen when a photo is tapped. We have no evidence of photos/videos uploaded due to this. We’re submitting a fix for this to the App Store today.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Facebook took down a meme containing the Pledge of Allegiance. Rating: Unproven About this rating In early July 2021, Facebook users shared a post that contained a meme and a comment that claimed without evidence that the meme had been removed from the social media platform by Facebook. Originally posted in 2019, the post contains and image of the flag along with the Pledge of Allegiance, and a \"challenge\" to repost the meme. We reached out to Facebook asking whether Facebook had removed the image at any point, but didn't get a response in time for publication. We will update if and when we do. Given that the meme is currently viewable on Facebook and, as of this writing, has been there for at least two years, however, it's unlikely that Facebook took it down on purpose at any point. Sometimes, Facebook's algorithms mistakenly limit posts, a phenomenon that has bred false claims that Facebook was \"censoring\" religious or patriotic content. The original Pledge of Allegiance was written in 1891 by Francis Bellamy. The phrase \"under God\" was added in the 1950s, and it currently reads, \"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\" The constitutionality of the phrase, because of its religious implications, has long been contested .",

Do not share; copy and paste [Collected via e-mail, October 2013] Channel 13 News was just talking about this change in Facebook's privacy policy. Better safe than sorry. As of October 14, 2013 at 5:50pm Eastern standard time, I do not give Facebook or any entities associated with Facebook permission to use my pictures, information, or posts, both past and future. By this statement, I give notice to Facebook it is strictly forbidden to disclose, copy, distribute, or take any other action against me based on this profile and/or its contents.

If you do not publish a statement at least once it will be tactically allowing the use of your photos, as well as the information contained in the profile status updates. DO NOT SHARE. You MUST copy and Paste Due to the fact that Facebook has chosen to involve software that will allow the theft of my personal information, I state: at this date of January 4, 2015, in response to the new guidelines of Facebook, pursuant to articles L.111, 112 and 113 of the code of intellectual property, I declare that my rights are attached to all my personal data drawings, paintings, photos, video, texts etc. published on my profile and my page. For commercial use of the foregoing my written consent is required at all times. Those who read this text can do a copy/paste on their Facebook wall. This will allow them to place themselves under the protection of copyright. By this statement, I tell Facebook that it is strictly forbidden to disclose, copy, distribute, broadcast, or take any other action against me on the basis of this profile and or its content. The actions mentioned above also apply to employees, students, agents and or other personnel under the direction of Facebook. The content of my profile contains private information. The violation of my privacy is punishable by law (UCC 1-308 1-308 1-103 and the Rome Statute). Facebook is now an open capital entity. All members are invited to publish a notice of this kind, or if they prefer, you can copy and paste this version. If you have not published this statement at least once, you tacitly allow the use of elements such as your photos as well as the information contained in the profile update. --> In both cases the claims were erroneous, an expression of the mistaken belief the use of some simple legal talisman — knowing enough to ask the right question or post a pertinent disclaimer — will immunize one from some undesirable legal consequence. The law just doesn't work that way. First off, the \"problem\" this ineffective solution supposedly addresses is a non-existent one: Facebook isn't claiming copyright to the personal information, photographs, and other material that their users are posting to the social network, nor have they announced any plans that would make all Facebook posts public (even previously deleted ones) regardless of a user's privacy settings): In response to rumors about copyright issues that began circulating in November 2012 after Facebook announced they were considering revoking users' rights to vote on proposed policy changes, the company issued a statement noting that: There is a rumor circulating that Facebook is making a change related to ownership of users' information or the content they post to the site. This is false. Anyone who uses Facebook owns and controls the content and information they post, as stated in our terms. They control how that content and information is shared. That is our policy, and it always has been. Click here to learn more: www.facebook.com/policies . Similarly, ABC News reported: [Users worried that] Facebook will own their photos or other media are posting [a frightful message] — unaware that it is a hoax. Here's the truth: Facebook doesn't own your media. \"We have noticed some statements that suggest otherwise and we wanted to take a moment to remind you of the facts — when you post things like photos to Facebook, we do not own them,\" Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes said in a statement. \"Under our terms you grant Facebook permission to use, distribute, and share the things you post, subject to the terms and applicable privacy settings.\" Brad Shear, a Washington-area attorney and blogger who is an expert on social media, said the message [that Facebook users are posting to their walls is] \"misleading and not true.\" He said that when you agree to Facebook's terms of use you provide Facebook a \"non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any content you post. You do not need to make any declarations about copyright issues since the law already protects you. The privacy declaration [in this message] is worthless and does not mean anything.\" In any case, Facebook users cannot retroactively negate any of the privacy or copyright terms they agreed to when they signed up for their accounts, nor can they unilaterally alter or contradict any new privacy or copyright terms instituted by Facebook, simply by posting a contrary legal notice on their Facebook walls. Moreover, the fact that Facebook is now a publicly traded company (i.e., a company that has issued stocks which are traded on the open market) or an \"open capital entity\" has nothing to do with copyright protection or privacy rights. Any copyright or privacy agreements users of Facebook have entered into with that company prior to its becoming a publicly traded company or changing its policies remain in effect: they are neither diminished nor enhanced by Facebook's public status. Before you can use Facebook, you must indicate your acceptance of that social network's legal terms , which includes its privacy policy and its terms and policies . You can neither alter your acceptance of that agreement nor restrict the rights of entities who are not parties to that agreement simply by posting a notice to your Facebook account, citing the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ), or referencing the Berne Convention . (One of the common legal talismans referenced above is UCC Section 1-308, which has long been popular among conspiracy buffs who incorrectly maintain that citing it above your signature on an instrument will confer upon you the ability to invoke extraordinary legal rights.) If you do not agree with Facebook's stated policies, you have several options: Decline to sign up for a Facebook account. Bilaterally negotiate a modified policy with Facebook. Lobby for Facebook to amend its policies through its Facebook Site Governance section. Cancel your Facebook account. (Note that in the last case, you may have already ceded some rights which you cannot necessarily reclaim by canceling your account.) As techtalk noted of Facebook users' current privacy rights: The fact is that Facebook members own the intellectual property (IP) that is uploaded to the social network, but depending on their privacy and applications settings, users grant the social network \"a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook (IP License).\" Facebook adds, \"[t]his IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.\" While the social network does not technically own its members content, it has the right to use anything that is not protected with Facebook's privacy and applications settings. For instance, photos, videos and status updates set to public are fair game. Similar memes A variation on this meme related to Snapchat photos , which was similarly false, went viral in summer 2019. A fresh variant alleging that a \" new Facebook/Meta rule \" allows the company to use members' photos without permission went viral in fall 2021.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Facebook introduced prayer request posts. Rating: True About this rating Context The new prayer request post type appeared to only be available in Facebook Groups, and first has to be enabled by an administrator. It's unclear if the new feature has already been fully rolled out to everyone. On June 3, 2021, a screenshot on Twitter purportedly featured Facebook's introduction of \"Prayer Request\" posts. The screenshot provided few details: Introducing Prayer Posts You may enable group members to ask for and respond to prayers in a post. You can manage Prayer Request posts and who can create them in Group Settings. Another tweet from June 1 also showed the same message in mobile view: The message has appeared as far back as December 2020. In April 2021, it was featured in a tweet from Robert P. Jones, the CEO and founder of the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI): According to Religion News Service (RNS) , a Facebook spokesperson said in April that the new prayer posts were being \"tested within a subset of groups in the United States.\" RNS reporter Emily McFarlan Miller published that the spokesperson said \"the idea for prayer posts grew out of the myriad ways users have connected over Facebook while distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.\" The new prayer request post type will allow group administrators to choose whether to opt-in to the feature. If an administrator activates the feature, group members can post prayer requests. Other members can respond in a variety of ways including by interacting with a \"Pray\" button. The story also mentioned the massive number of people who made video calls on religious holidays in 2020. At the time, family and friends were separated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The information was also featured in Facebook's Year in Review : Faith & Community: People used our platforms to build and maintain community, even at a distance. Communities rallied to shop local, as more than 47 million stories using the Support Small Business sticker were created on Instagram globally in the past 3 months. With in-person services on hold due to COVID-19 lockdowns, the holiday week of April 6 (Easter and Passover) was the biggest for group video calls on Messenger and the most popular week of Facebook Live broadcasts from spiritual Pages, ever. We reached out to Facebook for more information. A spokesperson sent over the following statement: In December, we started testing a feature in the U.S. to give people the option of requesting prayer from their Facebook Group. We made the default setting off, which means the group admin must first switch it on for members to use it. Once a prayer request has been posted, group members can choose to indicate they’ve prayed, react, leave a comment, or send a private message. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve seen many faith and spirituality communities using our services to connect, so we’re starting to explore new tools to support them. It's unclear when the new feature might become widely available. However, we will update this story should we receive further details.",

    "claim": "Police warned that Facebook quizzes could lead to identity theft.",
    "rating": "True",
    "article_text": "Claim: Police warned that Facebook quizzes could lead to identity theft. Rating: True About this rating On Nov. 18, 2019, WTMJ, a television news station in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, reported that, \"Facebook quizzes help identity thieves learn personal information, increasing people's risk of being scammed.\" The story has reemerged periodically since December 2017, when Sutton police in Massachusetts first issued the warning. At that time, ABC News picked up the story and published an article with the warning on Dec. 20, 2017. The warning was posted again in November 2019, this time by the Marathon County Sheriff's Office in Wisconsin. The story has been rehashed numerous times since it was originally posted in 2017. Prevention, a health and lifestyle magazine, for example, published a story on Dec. 26, 2018, warning: \"A nugget of information in isolation may not seem like a big deal, but combining that with other data that may be out there can result in a greater threat,\" [Rachel Rothman, Chief Technologist for the Good Housekeeping Institute] said. \"Be mindful of photos or posts that could give away information about your location or self (like your birthday) and consider if you are posting something that could be used to locate you offline or make it easier for someone to figure out any of your passwords.\" Rothman also recommends using \"fake\" information when filling out password recovery prompts (like your mother's maiden name or the name of your first teacher) that isn't trackable to you in any way. But above all, it's important to remember that everything you post on social media is public, no matter how secure your settings are. In many cases, the warnings caution that making personal information public, as many of these quizzes do, could provide potential scammers with key bits of personal data that can enable them to hack into accounts. The Better Business Bureau also cautions : Social media quizzes — especially popular on Facebook — seem innocent enough. But taking the quiz might mean you are giving away more about yourself than you originally thought, and may extend to your Friends, as well. These quizzes ask seemingly silly or useless questions, but hackers can use that information to penetrate your social accounts and gain access to your personal information or the information of your friends and family. Some quizzes are designed to steal your data in an outright scam. According to Khristian Ibarrola, of Inquirer.net “Once answered, hackers can easily hijack personal accounts and use them to lure in more victims.” The hackers will include links embedded in the quiz that can cause a security breach of your personal accounts. But the latest news shows that it isn’t just scammers who are interested in your quiz answers. It turns out, your personal information is big business. “We always knew someone was trying to trick us with social media quizzes, because they are free” says BBB’s chief security officer Bill Fanelli, CISSP. “If there is no charge, then the value is the data they can collect. We also knew that it was for a use we probably would not like, because they went to such great lengths to hide their purpose. Now we know we were right on both counts.” Perhaps the best-known case in which a Facebook quiz ended not only with personal data being stolen but also claims that that data could have been used to influence an election involved Cambridge Analytica. The personal information from millions of Facebook users who took a personality quiz was stolen in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A Facebook policy will begin in March 2024 that allows the company to do what it wishes with users' photos, but this can be prevented by copying and pasting a message into a new post. Rating: False About this rating In March 2024, Facebook users shared a news of a purported new Facebook policy that would allow Meta, the social media platform's parent company, to gain the rights to do what it wished with their posted photos. These users referred to this policy as a \"new Facebook rule\" and said \"it was even on TV,\" an apparent reference to perhaps a news broadcast or TV commercial. Such posts appeared with a blue-circle emoji after the word \"Hello\": The following text was copied and pasted: Hello. ? It's official. Signed at 8:16 PM. It was even on TV. Mine really turned blue. Don't forget that tomorrow starts the new Facebook rule (aka... new name, META) where they can use your photos. Don't forget the deadline is today!!! I do not authorize META, Facebook or any entity associated with Facebook to use my photos, information, messages or posts, past or future. With this statement, I notify Facebook that it is strictly prohibited to disclose, copy, distribute or take any other action against me based on this profile and/or its contents.

Then go to your page, create a new post and place your finger anywhere in the empty field. \"Paste\" will appear and click Paste. This will bypass the system…. He who does nothing consents. However, none of this was true. Snopes previously published multiple reports about this same Facebook rumor, including at least two variations of this same text. Such posts are known as copypasta , and such messages about purported new Facebook policies are perhaps the most shared type of these kinds of posts. Meta previously published of such rumors, \"Copy-and-paste memes — those blocks of text posted on message boards, forwarded in emails and shared via social media — are as old as the internet.\" In sum, no, there was not a \"new Facebook rule\" that appeared \"on TV.\" Further, a user copying and pasting a block of text onto their profile page will not change anything about the fact that they already agreed to the company's terms of service and privacy policy when they signed up for an account.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Meta announced plans that they will soon begin charging people \"this summer\" to use Facebook. Rating: False About this rating In October 2022, Facebook users copied and pasted posts that claimed, \"Facebook will start charging this summer.\" The copy-and-paste posts, which we refer to as copypasta , claimed that the news was \"official\" and that the posts had been \"signed\" by the users, a word that was sometimes misspelled as \"signal.\" The posts claimed the news had even been broadcast \"on TV.\" However, this was nothing more than a repeated iteration of a long-running Facebook hoax. To be clear, Meta has never announced any plans to charge Facebook users money in order for them to be able to use the platform. We found no shortage of these posts being copied and pasted in mid-October. A search for \"Facebook will start charging this summer\" returned a seemingly endless number of results . The copy-and-paste post usually read something like this, with the time changed in some posts depending upon when the user shared the text: It's official Signed at 10:33. It's even passed on TV. Facebook will start charging this summer. If you copy this to your wall your icon will turn blue and your Facebook will be free for you. Please pass this message, if not your icon will be deleted. P.S. this is serious, the icon will turn blue (Copy and paste to your wall) Mine really turned blue. After the \" Facebook will start charging this summer \" text, some of the posts that we found then continued by including words from previous iterations of this same hoax: Don't forget tomorrow starts the new Facebook (aka…new name, META) rule where they can use your photos. Don't forget the Deadline is today!!! I do not give Facebook or any entities associated with Facebook permission to use my pictures, information, messages or posts, both past and future. With this statement, I give notice to Facebook it is strictly forbidden to disclose, copy, distribute, or take any other action against me based on this profile and/or its contents. The information: The violation of privacy can be punished by law NOTE: Facebook is now a public entity. All members must post a note like this. If you prefer, you can copy and paste this version. If you do not publish a statement at least once it will be tacitly allowing the use of your photos, as well as the information contained in the profile status updates. DO NOT SHARE. Copy and paste. Their new algorithm chooses the same few people - about 25 - who will read your posts. Therefore: Hold your finger down anywhere in this post and \"copy\" will pop up. Click \"copy\". Then go to your page, start a new post and put your finger anywhere in the blank field. \"Paste\" will pop up and click paste This will bypass the system. We previously debunked this rumor in 2009 , then published another story about it in 2020. The version of the hoax that uses the words \"this summer\" had apparently been going around since at least 2011 . Despite being well over a decade old, Facebook users often share various posts that ask others to copy and paste the text , as if doing so would establish precautionary measures against a future development. However, as Jerry once told Kramer on the \"Seinfeld\" TV series, \"I don't know if what you have here constitutes a legally binding document.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: A screenshot accurately showed a list of X users, all prominent conservative accounts, who were allowed to post racial slurs without facing repercussions. Rating: Fake About this rating On July 25, 2024, an X user named \"Anti-Fascist Turtle\" posted an image allegedly showing a list of accounts on that social platform that were allowed to break the site's terms of service without penalty, including a list of racial slurs the accounts were supposedly allowed to use. The accounts included prominent conservative accounts like EndWokeness and LibsOfTikTok, former U.S. President Donald Trump, X owner Elon Musk and the official account of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The \"Anti-Fascist Turtle\" account was suspended by the platform not long after making the post. But it was too late — the post had already gone viral, and original poster's account being suspended only increased how fast the image spread. The original poster dubbed the screenshot and its supposed findings a \"Twitter API leak,\" and many users used that phrasing when sharing the post. Snopes readers wrote to ask us to investigate whether the Twitter API leak and its alleged findings were real. We found that the image was fake, and that the findings were not real. In order to best understand the fine details of the situation, Snopes spoke via direct message with cybersecurity expert and hacktivist maia arson crimew , best known for publishing a 2019 version of the TSA's no-fly list . Crimew drew specific attention to the content of the lists, calling them \"perfectly optimized for outrage,\" given the large public profiles of the accounts and the list of words the accounts could supposedly use consisted of mostly racial slurs. In response to the outrage, that poured in on the platform after the post went viral, X added the rarely-used \" manipulated media \" tag underneath the posts. However, crimew said adding the tag might have backfired because people were generally unfamiliar with it. \"It just made people think even harder it's a conspiracy,\" she said. Given some of the biases users on the platform hold against the company and Musk, crimew had a point. Seeing a \"manipulated media\" tag and the original poster's account suspension may have led people to believe the company was attempting to cover up \"the truth.\" So what was actually going on? Okta According to crimew, the screenshot claimed to show a \"configuration file\" for X hosted on an Okta server. The screenshot contained a list of accounts supposedly \"excluded from automatic moderation and a list of words [said accounts] allegedly aren't being automatically moderated for [using].\" Okta is a company known as an \"identity provider\" — it produces software that allows other companies to add authentication to sites. When signing into a modern website, users are asked to either provide a username and a password, or they can click a button allowing them to sign in with another platform, most commonly Google or Facebook. Okta makes software comparable to the \"sign in with Google\" button, but with even more power and integration behind the scenes. According to crimew, former X employees have said that the company did use Okta, but only internally. Furthermore, Okta's software plays no part in user moderation. In other words, finding information related to user moderation on an Okta server, which likely would have been managing logins and authentications, would be strange — like finding a live shark in a refrigerator. Snopes reached out to Okta to ask for a comment on the matter. A spokesperson for the company told us via email that the screenshot was fake. Moderation on X Another major problem with the supposed leak that X already had a moderation feature that could theoretically do the same thing. Internet moderation is frequently automated because people post too much content for humans to manually review all of it. However, automatic moderation creates its own problems, including mass reporting brigades. In order to avoid such problems, X can add a flag to individual account profiles that requires any moderation actions against that profile to be manually approved. While X does not officially state what this tool is meant for, crimew said social media sites use similar tools for three reasons: safeguarding against mass reporting; ensuring that official government accounts are not targeted by automatic moderation, which could otherwise have unintended geopolitical impacts; and to easily comply with requests to preserve social media activity from law enforcement agencies. The system has been public knowledge since the so-called \"Twitter Files,\" which Musk released to a select group of journalists and writers when he bought the company in 2022. A screenshot of the moderation tool appeared in a December 2022 TechCrunch article, where it was applied to the account LibsOfTikTok, also notably featured on the supposed list from the API leak. However, this simply underlies the fact that the X platform already has such a tool. Crimew said the supposed API leak would have been a second, more-primitive implementation of the same feature. In other words, if X leaders truly wanted to allow the small list of accounts present on the API leak to break the website's rules, they would have already had the tools to do so. Snopes reached out to X to ask for comment about the screenshot beyond the \"manipulated media\" tag the site had applied to the posts sharing the supposed leak. A spokesperson confirmed via email that the screenshot was fake. The spokesperson also provided us a link to a X post from one of the company's security engineers publicly stating that the screenshot was fake. At this point in our investigation, we were quite confident that the screenshot and its supposed findings were fake. Our last step was to attempt to determine where this misinformation came from. Vx-underground The story began with vx-underground , an online website and research group for malware that claims to have the world's largest collection of malware code samples. Vx-underground's administrator and founder, smelly_vx, takes tips and discusses cybersecurity breaches and hacks on the site's X account. According to a thread posted by the vx-underground account on X, smelly_vx received an anonymous DM on X with a link to the screenshot that would end up going viral. After a brief look, he chose to share the screenshot and information to vx-underground's Discord server. However, when he posted the image on Discord, writing \"prepare for twitter s***storm. someone found exposed okta configs for twitter. twitter gives priv[eliges] to right-wing platforms,\" he had not verified whether the information was legitimate. The group quickly began investigating the supposed leak, but could not reproduce anything. As such, vx-underground decided to pass the screenshot on to someone else to investigate. However, one unidentified user shared a redacted version of the post on Discord to X, leaving vx-underground members scrambling to figure out what had happened while the post was going viral. The vx-underground team declined to publish a correction because the issue would be \"forgotten in the next 2 days,\" but repeatedly directed commenters to a post explaining that they had not been able to independently verify any of the information. According to an X thread posted by the user Rhinozzcode, who collaborates with crimew, neither smelly_vx's announcement on the vx-underground Discord server nor the X post that sent the post viral noted that the supposed information had not yet been verified.",

    "claim": "In December 2024, the FBI issued guidelines warning iPhone and Android users to stop sending texts.",
    "rating": "Mostly True",
    "article_text": "Claim: In December 2024, the FBI issued guidelines warning iPhone and Android users to stop sending texts. Rating: Mostly True About this rating Context The FBI's guidelines recommended that users not send texts from iPhone to Android or vice versa because they were not securely encrypted. However, messages sent from iPhone to iPhone or Android to Android use slightly different technologies that are safely encrypted. In October 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported of a large cyberattack against U.S. telecommunications companies AT&T, Verizon and Lumen Technologies. The NSA's director, Gen. Timothy Haugh, told NBC News that the hackers were supported by China, something the Chinese government denied. On Dec. 3, 2024 , the FBI, the NSA and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency released new guidelines for protecting communications infrastructure in the United States in the wake of the breach. In a news conference about the effects of the hack, CISA Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity Jeff Greene mentioned that anyone with an iPhone or Android should stop sending text messages because they were not secure. This claim was widely reported on , and several Snopes readers wrote in to ask about the recommendation. The claim to stop sending text messages was mostly true. However, the FBI's definition of \"text message\" was significantly more strict than the general public's, meaning that not all messages sent on a phone applied. The main cellphone operating systems, iOS and Android, each have secure messaging systems (iMessage and Google Messages, respectively) for sending messages to a device of the same type that sent it (iPhone to iPhone or Android to Android). The FBI's advice recommends only that users do not send text messages from an iPhone to an Android or vice versa. Instead of sending text messages, officials suggested using an app that provides \" responsibly managed encryption.\" Think of encryption as a lock that requires a key to open. The most secure type of encryption, called end-to-end encryption, means that the message is locked before it is sent and unlocked on the other end. The FBI has previously criticized end-to-end encryption because it can sometimes slow down the agency's efforts to access information on locked devices. As such, it's unclear exactly what \"responsibly managed encryption\" means. The simplest solution is to use a messaging application with end-to-end encryption. Apple's iMessage and Android's Google Messages use end-to-end encryption when messaging users of the same platform, which is why iPhones can securely message other iPhones (the same applies to Androids). However, when an iPhone user wants to send a message to an Android user (or vice versa), the messages are encrypted using a different method, RCS , which is more vulnerable. For these cases, a third-party application with end-to-end encryption, such as WhatsApp or Signal , is the best choice. These apps also will encrypt any voice calls. Several reports said the large hack was not fully resolved, and that it was likely an attempt to gain access to private communications from government officials. According to Politico , the hackers were able to find call records and text messages of several high-ranking government officials, who were notified their private communications had been compromised.",

    "article_text": "Claim: The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was offering to cover part of the internet bill for eligible households that struggled to afford internet service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rating: True About this rating Snopes is still fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

The U.S. government wants to pick up some of the internet tab for millions of households across the country that have taken a financial hit during the COVID-19 pandemic . On May 12, 2021, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) opened up applications for the Emergency Broadband Benefit program, which provides discounts to households struggling to afford internet service. The program covers up to $50 towards the cost of internet services, and up to $75 for qualifying households on tribal lands. Additionally, qualifying households can also receive “a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating providers if they contribute more than $10 and less than $50 toward the purchase price.” According to the FCC news release , the following factors determine eligibility. Each qualifying household: Has an income that is at or below 135% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines or participates in certain assistance programs, such as SNAP, Medicaid, or Lifeline; Approved to receive benefits under the free and reduced-price school lunch program or the school breakfast program, including through the USDA Community Eligibility Provision in the 2019-2020 or 2020-2021 school year; Received a Federal Pell Grant during the current award year; Experienced a substantial loss of income due to job loss or furlough since February 29, 2020 and the household had a total income in 2020 at or below $99,000 for single filers and $198,000 for joint filers; or Meets the eligibility criteria for a participating provider's existing low-income or COVID-19 program. The FCC also has a “ Do I Qualify ” page with more details. One can apply for these benefits through the following ways: Contact your preferred participating broadband provider directly to learn about their application process. Go to GetEmergencyBroadband.org to apply online and to find participating providers near you. Call 833-511-0311 for a mail-in application, and return it along with copies of documents showing proof of eligibility to: Emergency Broadband Support Center P.O. Box 7081 London, KY 40742 After receiving an eligibility determination, households can contact their preferred service provider to select an Emergency Broadband Benefit eligible service plan. A list of broadband service providers working with the program is also available here . It should be noted that the program is temporary and will end \"when the fund runs out of money or six months after the Department of Health and Human Services declares an end to the COVID-19 health emergency.\" Given that the FCC released a statement on this and the program is now receiving applications, we rate this claim as “True.”",

    "article_text": "Claim: FEMA, in coordination with the FCC, will conduct a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System and Wireless Emergency Alert system on Oct. 4, 2023, by sending messages to every cell phone, TV and radio in the United States. Rating: True About this rating In early September 2023, readers asked Snopes for confirmation of reports they had seen online claiming that a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) were scheduled to be conducted on Oct. 4, 2023. According to these reports, warning tones and text alerts would be sent to all TVs, radios, and wireless phones at 2:20 p.m. EDT on that date. Should People with Hidden Safety Phones Turn Them Off During Oct. 4 Emergency Alert System Test? The reports were accurate. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had announced plans for the test two months earlier in an Aug. 3, 2023 public notice : Today, the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (Bureau) of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission) provides notice to all Emergency Alert System (EAS) Participants, Participating Commercial Mobile Service (CMS) Providers, and the public that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in coordination with the FCC, will conduct nationwide tests of the EAS and Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) on October 4, 2023. If conditions on that date require the rescheduling of the tests, they will be conducted on October 11, 2023. The announcement was widely covered by the news media in August and September, including by such outlets as The New York Times , Fox News , and CBS News . What can recipients of the alert expect? The Times elaborated as follows: Every television, radio and cellphone in the United States is going to broadcast a message on Oct. 4 along the lines of: \"THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.\" The test alert will be sent out around 2:20 p.m. Eastern time. The test will be conducted by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, working in coordination with the Federal Communications Commission. The test is intended to make sure that the alert system is ready to warn the public in the event of emergencies, particularly those that have a national impact, FEMA said in a statement . This will be the seventh time a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System has been conducted via radio and TV. It will be the second time the Wireless Emergency Alert system for cellular devices has been tested nationwide. (The first such test occurred on Oct. 3, 2018, during the Trump administration, and took the form of a national Presidential Alert .)",

    "article_text": "Claim: Video captured in 1938 shows a female \"time traveler\" talking on a cellphone. Rating: Miscaptioned About this rating At least since 2013, a video has circulated online, allegedly showing a female \"time traveler\" in 1938 talking on a cellphone. \"Time Traveler in 1938 film caught talking on a cell phone in 1938 comming out of a Dupont Factory in Massachusetts,\" one description of the video on YouTube read. \"This was filmed in 1938 at the massena new york aluminum company of america plant at the office,\" another YouTube channel captioned it . \"Sorry John, Your info is incorrect. This the the Dupont plant in Leominster, MA in Oct. 1938. The woman is holding a cigarette case,\" one user commented, while the original poster of the video replied \"this was an april fools joke video i made a few years ago for massena that ended up getting lots of views.\" The video and \"time traveler\" claim spread on other social media platforms as well, including Facebook and TikTok . But while the video itself is demonstrably authentic — that is to say, real and unaltered — the captions on posts suggesting someone in it was using a cellphone decades before the technology existed are false. The footage truly is from 1938. It was featured in a video titled, \"Leominster 1938 Film Supplemental Footage,\" uploaded in 2017 by the Leominster Access Television YouTube channel (the \"cellphone\" is visible around the 00:40 mark): In the video, a woman does briefly seem to be holding a device strikingly similar to a modern cellphone next to her ear, sparking fanciful theories that she was a \"time traveler.\" The video's poor visual quality and lack of sound make it impossible to conclusively determine what the woman was holding or doing at the time of the filming. Some social media users ventured other explanations that didn't rely on time travel, even citing actual technology available in the 1930s. \"It's a Siemens hearing instrument , patented in 1924 or a Western Electric Model 34A Audiphone Carbon Hearing Aid ,\" one YouTube user commented, for instance. Others simply resorted to different anachronisms, such as the respondent who wrote, \"In those days, small portable radios were very common. She's holding it to her ear to hear the program better because they are outside in a crowd. You could also see how she is at the same time in an active conversation with the two women to her left (our right) talking about what they're listening to.\" In point of fact, small portable radios didn't exist in 1938. Or the woman in the clip could have been holding a small purse or a cigarette case, some suggested. Additionally, users highlighted that the use of a cellphone in the 1930s would be impossible due to the absence of necessary cellular infrastructure, such as transceiver relay towers. A 2013 Daily Mail article with the lengthy title, \"Is this the world's first cell phone? Film from 1938 shows a woman talking on a wireless device... but it is not 'time travel' family say to the disappointment of conspiracy theorists,\" informed readers that a YouTube account called Planetcheck claimed the woman in the video was Gertrude Jones, the YouTube user's great-grandmother. The article read: But in recent days a user called 'planetcheck' has come forward, claiming to have solved the mystery. Planetcheck said: 'The lady you see is my great grandmother Gertrude Jones.' 'She was 17 years old. I asked her about this video and she remembers it quite clearly. She says Dupont had a telephone communications section in the factory.' 'They were experimenting with wireless telephones. Gertrude and five other women were given these wireless phones to test out for a week.' 'Gertrude is talking to one of the scientists holding another wireless phone who is off to her right as she walks by.' So far there has been no independent verification of planetcheck's post, but another YouTube user who says he knows someone else who worked at the factory has vowed to make further inquiries. However, the user behind Planetcheck remained anonymous and has not provided further evidence to back up the claim. \"Although the claims were reported on by a handful of big news outlets, they've never been 100 percent verified, although Planetcheck's version of events seems a whole bunch more plausible than time travel,\" a UNILAD article on the topic concluded . We have reached out to Dupont via email and will update this article if/when we receive a response. We have fact-checked several time travel -related claims in the past. For instance, in December 2022, we investigated viral rumors of a visit from time traveler from the year 2036 that have floated online since 2000. Moreover, in April 2016, we fact-checked a video allegedly showing a time-traveling spectator using a camera phone to take photographs at a Mike Tyson fight back in 1995. In February 2015, we debunked a photograph from the 1940s allegedly showing an obviously out-of-place, time-traveling hipster.",

Taken by Philippe Kahn of his newborn daughter, on June 11th, 1997. by u/Emanuele810 in Damnthatsinteresting Google reverse-image search results showed the photo was shared on various social media platforms such as Instagram , X (formerly Twitter) and Imgur . In short, the photo was authentic; however, it wasn't captured with a camera integrated into a cellphone. It was, rather, the first digital-camera photograph transmitted by a cellphone. Therefore, we have rated the claim as \"Miscaptioned.\" An article by Peta Pixel, referencing an interview with Kahn by IEEE Spectrum , explained that he captured the photograph of his newborn daughter using a makeshift setup that combined a flip phone, a digital camera and a laptop computer (emphasis ours): Since \"camera phones\" didn't exist at that time, Kahn actually hacked together a primitive one by combining his digital camera and a cell phone to send the photos across the Web in real-time. The makeshift setup consisted of a Motorola StarTAC flip phone, a Casio QV digital camera, and a Toshiba 430CDT laptop computer, according to IEEE Spectrum. Whenever he captured a 320×240-pixel photo with the camera, the setup would automatically connect to his web server and upload the photo and then send email notifications to friends and family to provide a link to the new image. \"I had always wanted to have this all working in time to share my daughter's birth photo,\" Kahn tells IEEE Spectrum, \"but I wasn't sure I was going to make it.\" Luckily for the inventor, though, his wife would spend 18 hours in labor, giving him sufficient time to get the system up and working before his daughter was born. All the components he needed were either in his car or available at a local Radio Shack that he sent an assistant to. In 2016, Time magazine recognized Kahn's photograph as one of the 100 most impactful photographs in history. \"When Philippe Kahn rigged his cell phone to take a picture of his newborn daughter nearly 20 years ago, he could scarcely imagine that his invention would change the world,\" the article read. We connected with Kahn via email, and he offered deeper insight into the viral photograph's story: On that day [June 11, 1997], we didn't just share \"the first\" photo over cellular networks; we pioneered a cloud-based solution for media sharing at an unprecedented scale. That image reached over 2,000 people instantaneously, a feat made all the more remarkable considering the limitations of public wireless networks at the time, which were capped at 1200 baud rates. This achievement wasn't about the hardware—it wasn't an integrated phone camera as we know them today. The infrastructure we developed laid the groundwork for what has evolved into today's social media platforms. The principles behind what we built back then can be seen as a precursor to the foundational technology of platforms like Instagram. [...] The first commercial application of our system was with J-Phone in Japan in 1999. They utilized our infrastructure IP, inspired by that pioneering photograph. The device in question was developed by Sharp and marketed by J-Phone, marking the birth of the first commercially viable phone that integrated our technological infrastructure. (Learn more about the photograph's backstory here .) The first cellphone with a camera was not available to consumers until May 1999, when the Kyocera Visual Phone VP-210 was released in Japan: (Getty Images) The website of Science Museum explained that the VP-210 \"was the first commercially available mobile camera phone and the first mobile colour videophone\": Designed with a forward-facing camera, it pre-dated the popularity of so-called selfies in the early 2000s. The phone was considered \"revolutionary\" at the time of launch. The phone was developed by Kyocera Corporation, an electronics manufacturer based in Kyoto between 1997 and 1999. The 155 gram (5.5 oz.) camera could also take 20 photos and convey them by e-mail, with the camera phone retailing at the time for 40,000 yen, about US$325 in 1999. We have covered other stories about photographic firsts in the past. In October 2020, we debunked an image allegedly showing the world's first photograph of a cat. In October 2021, we explained the story behind the alleged first photograph captured of a planetary system outside our solar system.",

    "article_text": "Claim: The space tech startup Orbital Assembly announced in early 2021 that it was planning to begin construction on the world's first \"space hotel\" by 2026. Rating: Correct Attribution About this rating In early 2021, a space startup announced plans to begin construction on \"the world’s first space hotel\" in 2025 with a planned opening set for 2027. However, it is not yet known how feasible the project is or if construction could be completed by the proposed date. In a Feb. 1 virtual announcement , space tech company Orbital Assembly described its vision for luxury vacations of the future that are “literally out of this world\" — priced around $5 million per person. Following a delay caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the company said that it was on track to begin construction on what is deemed to be the world's first \"space hotel\" by 2026 at the latest. Representatives with the company predict that the commercial Voyager Station will take just a year or two to assemble, putting it on track — if all goes to plan — for an opening around 2027. (By comparison, it took scientists and engineers 10 years and more than 30 missions to finish the International Space Station in 2011.) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m50A-3OLGd0&feature=youtu.be The details are outlined in promotional material shared on the Orbital Assembly website. Described as the \"world's first large-scale space construction company,\" Orbital Assembly was soliciting investors and had raised $1 million with a valuation of more than $23.3 million. In 2021, the company was headed by former pilot John Blincow, CEO and President, and Vice President Tom Spilker, a former scientist and engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. But let's be clear here: The feasibility of the space station remains largely in question. Snopes contacted SpaceX to confirm its supposed partnership with Orbital Assembly but did not hear back at the time of publication. In an email from NASA, spokesperson Stephanie Schierholz said that the agency could not comment directly on the feasibility of the project as it does not have insight into the company’s plans, but did offer the following statement: NASA changed some of its policies about what activities can take place on the International Space Station in June 2019 in our efforts to support a robust low-Earth orbit economy , which includes space tourism. This continues NASA’s efforts toward commercialization that began when NASA contracted with commercial companies to deliver cargo to the space station and is continuing with our commercial crew program in which NASA has contracts with Boeing and SpaceX to fly astronauts to space. Part of NASA’s goals were that we not be the only customer for those services, that the companies can expand who has access to spaceflight. Schierholz added that future commercial destinations in low-Earth orbit are an essential element of a robust low-Earth orbit economy and will be essential to NASA’s plans to transition from using the International Space Station to using commercial destinations. Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin are also working toward suborbital spaceflights. “As a first step, NASA has awarded Axiom Space a contract to provide at least one habitable commercial module to be attached to the space station,” she wrote. International permits and filing requirements needed for a private company to launch a commercial endeavor in space are issued by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ). The agency is responsible for ensuring the protection of the public, property, and national security and foreign policy interests of the United States during commercial launch or reentry activities, and to encourage, facilitate, and promote U.S. commercial space transportation. And the training of guests will be left up to the commercial providers to determine. Future space guests would supposedly be required to make a reservation and undergo physical and safety training before renting — or buying — a 5,300-square-foot villa complete with cooking facilities, three bathrooms, and sleeping accommodations for up to 16 people. According to the company website, villas can be booked for a week, rented for a month, or purchased as a vacation home. Smaller hotel suites will also theoretically be available for a three-day trip or monthlong rental and come with a private bathroom and sleeping accommodations for up to two people. Voyager Station is hyped in promotional materials as a rotating station designed to produce varying levels of artificial gravity. Guests would be transported from Earth via the SpaceX Starship shuttle. Designed to accommodate 280 guests and 112 crew members, the station will be designed in three phases and will eventually feature a gym, restaurant, cinema, and sky bar. \"Voyager Station will leverage the technologies of space and the comforts of Earth to create a unique experience unparalleled in history,\" wrote the company on its website . \"Simulated gravity will offer amenities like toilet facilities, showers, and beds that function similar to what you are used to on Earth.\" Each facet of the hotel would be added as a module sort of like LEGO pieces. The Gymnasium and Activity (GA) module, for example, would feature a large recreation hall with 23-foot ceilings for \"jumping, running, and playing sports in the one-sixth Earth gravity environment,\" while the lower-level gym would be equipped with weights and treadmills so users could \"work out while watching the Earth and stars rotate below.\" Don't fancy working out? The company said that the GA will transform into a concert venue at night where the \"biggest musicians on Earth will rock the station\" — none of whom have yet been announced. But just because construction is slated to happen doesn’t necessarily mean it will. As Gizmodo pointed out, such futuristic space hotels have been promised for the last six decades — and none has yet been delivered.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A picture titled \"five dancing Israelis\" authentically shows five shirtless men recording themselves waving an Israeli flag on 9/11 as the World Trade Center's twin towers burn in the background. Rating: Fake About this rating In mid-August 2024, users on Elon Musk's X social media platform discussed a picture captioned \"five dancing Israelis.\" The image purportedly showed five shirtless men celebrating with an Israeli flag against the backdrop of the 9/11 terrorist attacks as the World Trade Center's twin towers filled the sky with fire and smoke. For example, on Aug. 14, the user @Partisangirl shared the picture with the caption, \" Never forget. Five dancing Israelis.\" As of this writing, that post ( archived ) had received 774,000 views, 3,300 reposts and 12,000 likes. However, the truth was the image was not a real photo. A different user generated the image with an artificial-intelligence tool. A user with the handle @CensoredMen posted ( archived ) the picture minutes earlier, referencing Musk's xAI Grok chatbot. The user wrote, \"Grok AI generates pretty accurate images,\" implying that was the tool used to create the image. Minutes later, the same user posted another AI-generated image of fire, smoke, ambulances with their lights on and blood running through streets. The foreground of the fake picture ( archived ) appeared to show Israeli soldiers holding an Israeli flag and a bloody certificate sarcastically displaying the words, \"Most Moral Army.\" BBC Verify journalist Shayan Sardarizadeh first reported the truth about the fake \"five dancing Israelis\" image in a post ( archived ) on X. We sent a direct message via X to @CensoredMen to confirm whether the owner of the account created the fake picture central to this story. We also emailed @PartisanGirl to ask whether the owner of that account was aware the image was fake before sharing it. We will update this story if we receive any responses. Another 'Chaotic' Rollout for Musk On the same day users shared the two fake pictures, The Verge reported on the launch of Grok-2 and Grok-2 mini, \"two new models of its Grok chatbot that offer upgraded performance and new image-generation capabilities.\" Five hours later, The Verge published a second article describing the rollout of the new models as just \"as chaotic as everything else on Elon Musk's social network\": Subscribers to X Premium, which grants access to Grok, have been posting everything from Barack Obama doing cocaine to Donald Trump with a pregnant woman who (vaguely) resembles Kamala Harris to Trump and Harris pointing guns. With US elections approaching and X already under scrutiny from regulators in Europe, it's a recipe for a new fight over the risks of generative AI. For further reading, we previously reported about a fake, AI-generated audio clip of former U.S. President Donald Trump saying Republicans are \"the dumbest group of voters in the country.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: Adobe announced that Flash Player would no longer be supported. Rating: True About this rating Adobe announced in 2017 that Adobe Flash Player, better known over the years simply as \"Flash,\" would no longer be supported after December 2020. Twitter users asked why — Flash had been around for 24 years, even being used by YouTube for nearly a decade to play its videos (it now uses HTML5), and was known as the technology behind popular websites such as the online cartoon series Homestar Runner : On the Adobe website, the company explained the reason for discontinuing support, referring to Flash as being at its \"end of life\": Open standards such as HTML5, WebGL, and WebAssembly have continually matured over the years and serve as viable alternatives for Flash content. Also, major browser vendors are integrating these open standards into their browsers and deprecating most other plug-ins (like Flash Player). See Flash Player EOL announcements from Apple , Facebook , Google , Microsoft and Mozilla . By providing more than three years’ advance notice, Adobe believes that there has been sufficient time for developers, designers, businesses, and other parties to migrate Flash content to new standards. The EOL timing was in coordination with some of the major browser vendors. Google Chrome and other browsers have been reminding users that support for Flash would be ending, such as this Chrome message that users may have seen a few too many times in the last two years: Adobe published instructions on how to ensure that Flash is removed from Windows and Mac computers. The company also said it would \"block Flash content from running in Flash Player beginning January 12, 2021,\" explaining the move was \"to help secure users' systems.\" Flash first launched in 1996. For some perspective on how long ago that was, Flash debuted during President Bill Clinton's first term in the White House. As Flash's time was about to come to an end, some people expressed frustration over the fact that old games that need Flash may no longer be playable: While it's true that Flash's \"end of life\" was imminent, Homestar Runner already re-uploaded its content to YouTube years ago. As for games, Tom Fulp, who runs Newgrounds.com , created a way to run a handful of old Flash games without the need for Flash. He tweeted that they are using Ruffle.rs , \"a Flash Player emulator built in the Rust programming language.\" We appreciate Tomas for sending in this tip. While a lot of popular Flash content was being archived and saved for the future, Adobe Flash Player was coming to an end:",

    "article_text": "Claim: Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida will be the first to implement semi-autonomous robotic “canines” in their defense regiment. Rating: True About this rating In November 2020, Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB) in Florida announced that it would be among the first to deploy semi-autonomous four-legged unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) — nicknamed “robot dogs” — as a new security feature. Snopes readers asked our team to verify the veracity of this claim, which we determined to be true. During a Nov. 10 event held at Tyndall AFB, which is located near Panama City, announced “computerized canines,” making it the first military base in the U.S. to implement semi-autonomous UGVs in a defense regime. Tyndall AFB and the 325th Security Forces Squadron partnered with Ghost Robotics , a technological robotic company that manufactures legged robotics for military and homeland security. The robots are designed with all-terrain stability and a “reduced mechanical complexity” that allows for a reduced cost, but increased durability and agility. “These robot dogs will be used as a force multiplier for enhanced situational awareness by patrolling areas that aren’t desirable for human beings and vehicles,” said Major Jordan Criss, who commands the 325th Security Forces Squadron, in a news release . “We will be able to drive them via a virtual-reality headset within our Base Defense Operations Center,” he continued. “We will be able to see exactly what the robot dog is detecting through its mobile camera and sensor platform if desired, we will also be able to issue verbal commands to a person or people through a radio attached to the dogs.” Tiffany Price/USAF Though the robots walk on all fours like a dog, they will not replace military working dogs. Rather, the UGVs are to be programmed with a predetermined path that they will patrol semi-autonomously and only be controlled as needed by a person with a virtual reality headset. Officials with Tyndall said that the robotic dogs will help relieve patrolling duties so that military personnel can focus on security needs that require an in-person presence, like training, security and general situational awareness. In the future, the UGVs hold the potential to one day replace defense equipment that military officials consider static. “These dogs will be an extra set of eyes and ears while computing large amounts of data at strategic locations throughout Tyndall Air Force Base,” said Criss. “They will be a huge enhancement for our defenders and allow flexibility in the posting and response of our personnel.\" U.S. Air Force Col.

    "article_text": "Claim: In July 2023, during protests over the police shooting of a teenager, France announced it was restricting internet access. Rating: False About this rating In July 2023, claims began to spread on social media platforms that France had restricted \"all internet access\" across the country. The claim began to spread as people across the country protested the deadly police shooting of a 17-year-old in a suburb of Paris. \"BREAKING: FRANCE TO RESTRICT ALL INTERNET ACCESS STARTING TONIGHT,\" Twitter account @NewsForYouUS posted on July 2, 2023. Attached to the tweet was a supposed news release from the Ministry of the Interior announcing that \"temporary restrictions\" would be applied to internet access in \"specific neighborhoods\" during the night. (The letter was originally written in French. We translated using Google Translate.) BREAKING: FRANCE TO RESTRICT ALL INTERNET ACCESS STARTING TONIGHT. pic.twitter.com/jx3Q9Bcv1l — News For You (@NewsForYouUS) July 2, 2023 We also found posts with the supposed mews release on other social media platforms, like TikTok and Facebook , in addition to unrelated Twitter posts. The news release wasn't real. The Interior Ministry's Twitter account posted that the document was fake and that no decision had been made about restricting internet access as of July 2, 2023. (The tweet was originally written in French. We translated it using the platform's translate feature.) #ViolencesUrbaines | Attention aux #FakeNews ?Un communiqué de presse de la @PoliceNationale annoncerait des restrictions temporaires à l'accès internet dans certains quartiers. ❌Ce document est un FAUX : aucune décision n'a été prise en ce sens. pic.twitter.com/LQYPKxp0KO — Ministère de l'Intérieur et des Outre-mer (@Interieur_Gouv) July 2, 2023 We reached out to the French Interior Ministry and will update this fact-check if we hear back. The Twitter account of France's Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs also tweeted about the claim on July 3, 2022, stating it was fake. #UrbanViolence | Beware of #FakeNews ? A \"press release\" from the French national police force @PoliceNationale has claimed that temporary restrictions have been imposed on Internet access in certain neighbourhoods. ❌ This document is FALSE: no such decision has been taken. pic.twitter.com/IyvFK3bN1z — France Diplomacy???? (@francediplo_EN) July 3, 2023 We checked the website of the Interior Ministry and found no news release that addressed restricting internet access in France. At the time of publication, the last news release from the ministry was posted on June 30, 2023, about the French interior minister and digital minister meeting with representatives of various social media platforms. (The news release was originally written in French. We translated it using Google Translate.) There were other indicators that the release wasn't real. When we downloaded real news releases from the official website of the French interior ministry, we found the dates on the releases were written with the month spelled out. However, the date on the fake release was written fully numerically. We've fact-checked other claims about the 2023 French protests, including a miscaptioned video of a French Apple store being looted.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A picture of a road lined with trees shows a Tesla charging with a gas generator in the U.S. Rating: Miscaptioned About this rating On Nov. 7, 2021, the Twitter account Thinking Patriot tweeted a photograph of a Tesla car that appeared to be in the process of charging using a gas generator. It also appeared on Facebook . This claim might remind readers of a previous fact check about a picture that purportedly showed a \"diesel car charging station\" for electric cars. The Picture The photograph in question shows a Tesla, a fully electric car, and likely a gas generator on the side of a tree-lined road: The user, who claimed to be based in California, tweeted \"welcome to 2021\" and included a hashtag for the Green New Deal , a proposed plan that is mostly about addressing climate change. We also found a Reddit user who believed the picture was shot in a \"hillbilly red state that refused funding for EV charge stations.\" Green New Deal The tweet in question may have been an attempt to make fun of the very real climate crisis, which is a non-political, science-based issue that for decades has been discussed by those in opposition to reality as if it's a matter of personal opinion. On Oct. 30, 2021, The Associated Press (AP) reported on the dire nature of the current situation: Fires raged. Rivers flooded. Ice melted. Droughts baked. Storms brewed. Temperatures soared. And people died. Climate change in 2021 reshaped life on planet Earth through extreme weather. World leaders are gathering in Scotland to try to accelerate the fight to curb climate change. So far, it’s not working, as the world keeps getting hotter and its weather more extreme, scientists and government officials say. They don’t have to point far back in time or far off for examples. The Green New Deal is mostly supported by a number of Democratic politicians . As AP reported in 2019, some \"GOP lawmakers denounced the plan as a radical proposal that would drive the economy off a cliff and lead to a huge tax increase.\" The Photograph's Origins In reality, the photograph was not captured in the United States. We found some Imgur and Reddit users who believed it was shot in either Nigeria or Syria . The license plate appeared to match the style used in the United Arab Emirates, possibly in Dubai, as Reddit users pointed out . Whatever the case, it's clear that the picture was not taken in North America. A Reddit user commented on the picture, posting : \"Sometimes I use an ELECTRIC battery charger to start my truck. What's your point?\" Another person responded : \"I agree with you. If the battery on the car is dead and it’s 100% electric you have to charge the battery somehow. This is probably the only option. People run out of gas while driving. This is no different. The Facepalm is running out of battery, not using a gas generator to charge an electric car [Tesla].\" The same Thinking Patriot Twitter user also posted an un-captioned cover image of a single Tesla Supercharger station that was underwater. However, according to a report , this one station was in the U.K. and appeared to be a planning error as it was built on a flood plain. Further, there are more than 25,000 other Tesla Supercharger stations available worldwide. A Second Picture While this photograph was not shot in the U.S., we did find a similar one that was . It also showed a Tesla car and what looked like a gas generator. According to Google Maps , as of November 2021, there are Tesla Supercharger stations near this location in Vancouver, Washington. However, it's unclear if those stations were there when the picture was taken. We did not find the second picture being used in any political memes. Can a Gas Generator Charge a Tesla? As for the separate question of whether a gas generator could add battery life to a Tesla vehicle, one YouTube account put the idea to the test. The Fast Lane Car channel posted a video that showed the process might be quite complicated. According to the conclusion of the experiment, the person was able to add around 12 driving miles to the car by pouring a single gallon of gas into a generator. It took about three hours. Those extra miles might be enough to make it to a nearby Tesla Supercharger station for the very small number of drivers who might ever be stranded with an empty battery. In sum, a picture of a Tesla car being charged with a gas generator was shared as if it had something to do with American politics. While we did find a completely different photograph that was shot in the U.S., the picture in question wasn't even captured in North America. Further, in a general sense, a single photograph of one example of anything does not represent the reality of an entire subject.

    "article_text": "Claim: Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is buying hundreds of burned-out lots destroyed in the August 2023 Maui wildfires for \"pennies on the dollar.\" Rating: Labeled Satire About this rating In September 2023, The Dunning-Kruger Times website published a story that said Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates was spending \"pennies on the dollar\" to buy up lots that had been burned up by the August 2023 Maui wildfires in Hawaii. The headline read, \"Bill Gates is Buying Hundreds of Burned Up Lots in Maui for 'Pennies on the Dollar.'\" The story said that Gates was targeting affected areas in Lahaina to execute his plans: First, there was Oprah and The Rock and their obvious ploy to shoulder the general public with the burden of helping people while they head off to find new prime land with nothing but what used to be a home or business on it. According to reports, Bill Gates is in on the action, buying \"hundreds of burnt-out houses at pennies on the dollar.\" Gates says he's hoping to grab enough parcels to have the southern end of Lahaina rezoned commercial so he can put a \"global facility\" in Hawaii that will \"spread Microsoft and Gates Foundation services to the far east.\" In other words…China. However, this item about Gates and the Maui fires was not a factual recounting of real-life events. The Dunning-Kruger Times is under the umbrella of America's Last Line of Defense , a network of content that's described on the Times' website as containing \"parody, satire, and tomfoolery.\" Any users who continued to read the article to the end would have found that it poked fun at readers who believed the story was true. For further reading, the article's mention of entertainment icon Oprah Winfrey and actor The Rock creating their People's Fund of Maui was a subject we previously reported about as being rife with misinformation. For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor.",

    "claim": "Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates said that U.S. citizens must accept digital IDs by 2028 or face exclusion from society. ",
    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates said that U.S. citizens must accept digital IDs by 2028 or face exclusion from society. Rating: False About this rating In mid-January 2024, a meme about Microsoft Co-Founder Bill Gates and digital identifications (IDs) was shared widely on the social media platform X: (Twitter) The meme said: \"Bill Gates: 'Digital ID Must Be Accepted by US citizen by 2028' Otherwise, risk 'exclusion from society\" As Snopes explained in a 2020 fact check, a digital ID is both a real concept that Gates has championed and a buzzword for Bill Gates conspiracy theorists. As a real concept , it merely refers, broadly, to technology involving the cloud-based storage of personal-identification documents or other files accessible only with the consent of the owner, but available anywhere in the world. To conspiracy theorists, the concept is evidence of a group of unelected global elites who want to digitally control and surveil society. The meme in question did not display an actual quote or sentiment expressed by Gates, however. The alleged quote stems from a December 2023 headline on a website — The People's Voice — that blends real news events with false and conspiratorial details: The People's Voice is a rebrand of Newspunch, a long-time and well-known producer of disinformation. Its December story rehashed claims made in a November post that the United Nations said digital IDs \"will be mandatory to participate in society.” Both pieces cite a program known as the 50-in-5 campaign as evidence. That campaign seeks to bring what is referred to as digital public infrastructure (DPI) to 50 countries in five years. As the initiative's website explains , DPI encompasses digital IDs along with other technology: [DPI] refers to a secure and interoperable network of components that include digital payments, ID, and data exchange systems – [and] is essential for participation in markets and society in a digital era. DPI is needed for all countries to build resilient and innovative economies, and for the well-being of people. The initiative is not exclusively the domain of Gates or the United Nations. According to the initiative's website, \"50-in-5 is a country-led advocacy campaign in collaboration with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure, Co-Develop, Digital Public Goods Alliance, and United Nations Development Programme, and is supported by GovStack, the Inter-American Development Bank, and UNICEF.\" Both the United Nations and Gates, in a fact check by USA Today of a November 2023 iteration of the story, denied advocating for any DPI that is mandatory, or that by necessity excludes people from society: The claim is false, spokespeople for the United Nations Development Program and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told USA TODAY. “The United Nations has not, at any point, claimed that digital ID will become mandatory,” Victor Garrido Delgado, the development program's spokesperson, said in an email. Because there is no evidence that Gates ever expressed the sentiment or quote about digital identification in viral memes, and because his charitable foundation (and the United Nations) have denied expressing or supporting it as well, we rate this claim as \"False.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: An authentic photograph shows the body of a massive octopus washed up on the coast of Indonesia. Rating: Fake About this rating Context The image was generated by artificial intelligence. In early June 2024, an image allegedly showing a giant octopus washed up on an Indonesian beach went viral. Numerous posts on X claimed it was a photograph taken in Bali. The image showed five tentacles and the body of the octopus, with several beachgoers standing near it and more bystanders in the distance. (X user @mulder_17) (X user @CMDRVALTHOR) The photograph is fake and generated by artificial intelligence (AI). Using Google's reverse-image search tool, we found no authentic source for the above image. Nor did we find any news outlets reporting on it, or any photographer claiming to have taken this picture. We did, however, find the image shared on Instagram by best_of_ai_ , a self-described \"Digital Creator\" who experiments \"with different ai engines, themes and styles.\" This was the earliest example of the image that we could find, four days before it went viral on X. The image was shared within a video that purported to show the so-called octopus from different angles on the beach. We contacted the Instagram user to determine if they were the original creator of this image , and will update this post if we learn more. The image caption identified it as a \"fictional\" creation and titled it as \"The Mourning of the Abyssal Titans\": In the quiet hours before dawn, the world's beaches trembled. The waves whispered secrets, and the sands shifted uneasily. The enormous octopus, its eyes like ancient moons, emerged from the depths—a titan awakened. Its tentacles, thick as ship masts, reached for the shore. Dead creatures clung to its suckers: bloated fish, forgotten sailors, and lost treasures. The sun rose, casting a sepulchral glow upon the beast. Tourists fled, their sun hats abandoned. Lifeguards blew whistles, but their warnings were futile. The octopus pulled up more corpses—seagulls, crabs, and driftwood. The beaches became a graveyard. Scientists arrived, cameras clicking. They measured the creature's span: nine meters, a record-breaking giant. The world watched in awe and horror as the octopus mourned its fallen kin. Beachgoers wept, their toes touching the cold, lifeless bodies. Children built sandcastles atop whale bones. And the octopus, its eyes haunted, retreated back to the abyss. The tides whispered its lament: \"Weep not for the dead, but for the forgotten. For we all return to the sea, whether by storm or by choice.\" And so, the beaches bore witness to the sorrow of ancient depths. ?? This is a fictional story The Instagram account displays a range of AI-generated images that are clearly not real. Had the image been of a genuine octopus of that size, it would certainly have been covered in environmental news stories and had a verifiable source.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A video authentically shows a woman holding a giant, white rabbit. Rating: Fake About this rating Online users are shared a video in October 2024 claiming the clip showed a woman holding a giant, white rabbit. The woman appears to be standing in a room filled with cardboard boxes. For example, on Oct. 17, X user @Catshealdeprsn posted ( archived ) the video with the caption, \"Giant rabbit.\" Other users also posted the same video on Facebook , Threads , X and YouTube . One user on Threads posted a caption in Arabic that translated to, \"A rabbit was raised with the best care at home and became one of the family members of the house.\" However, the truth was the video originated from a user who used artificial-intelligence (AI) tools. Self-described professional AI trainer and digital artist Jyo John Mulloor posted the video on Facebook and Instagram on Oct. 14. As of Oct. 17, the Facebook version received over 477,000 views, while the Instagram post displayed 17.7 million views. The caption revealed more about the creation of the video showing the giant bunny, namely that Mulloor used th e generative AI platforms Midjourney and Kling AI. It read, \"Congrats, Nicole! Your magical giant rabbit that speaks like a human is absolutely amazing!\" While some of the top comments mentioned the video's AI origins, other users appeared to be unsure if the clip was genuine or fake. For example, one user asked, \" Is he real???\" That comment alone received over 300 likes. Another user said in jest, \"Stop feeding the Cadbury bunny.\" We reached out to Mulloor to ask about his AI creations and will update this story if we receive a response. Newborn Unicorns and Giant Owls While Mulloor's video of the giant rabbit achieved nearly 18 million views, that count was quite small compared to other clips he previously posted, namely the three he pinned to the top of his feed. For example, on Sept. 28, he posted a video of a young girl holding a unicorn with wings ( archived ). The caption once again mentioned both Midjourney and Kling AI, adding, \"After a long wait, we finally picked up our little one from DHL yesterday! Welcome home, magical baby!\" The clip received over 320 million views. In another unicorn-inspired video posted on Oct. 5 ( archived ), Mulloor shared a brief clip appearing to show baby unicorns. The caption mentioned Midjourney and Kling AI, and added, \"Welcome to the world, newborn babies! Our farm is blessed with 16 new little ones, some of them with single horns too.\" The video received more than 75 million views. On the following day, Oct. 6, he posted a video showing a woman holding a giant owl ( archived ). He once again named the same generative AI tools, and said, \" Congrats, Jenny! Your magical owl that speaks like a human is absolutely amazing!\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: A screenshot shows an authentic email announcing that Gmail — Google's email service — would be shutting down in August 2024. Rating: Fake About this rating On Feb. 22, 2024, X (formerly Twitter) user @growing_daniel posted a screenshot of what appeared to be an email from Google Analytics announcing that the company would be \"sunsetting\" Gmail, the company's email service. \"This is insane. I hate this company,\" it was captioned. More than 8.4 million people viewed the post, as of this writing, and 10,000 users liked it. About an hour earlier, X account @SHL0MS also posted the alleged announcement, garnering more than 2 million views, as of this writing. The alleged email claimed that Gmail would be \"sunsetted\" in the \"spirit of progress and adaptation\" and that the company was focusing \"resources on developing new technologies and platforms that will continue to revolutionize the way we communicate and interact online.\" It said users would have until Aug. 1, 2024, to access and download emails, after which Gmail accounts would become inaccessible. (Image via X account @SHL0MS) This was completely false; the image was fabricated, so we have rated this claim \"Fake.\" If there were any truth to this claim, there would be information available on the official Google site and prominent tech-news outlets would have reported on it. As far as we can determine using Google's reverse image search, the post can be traced back to X account @SHL0MS. At this time we are unable to determine whether it was originally an email from Google Analytics that was altered or created entirely from scratch. A few hours after the initial posts went viral, the official X account for Gmail posted confirmation that the email service was not shutting down. Gmail is here to stay. — Gmail (@gmail) February 22, 2024 Multiple news outlets reported on the hoax, including the New York Post , Yahoo and MSN .",

    "claim": "In May 2022, Gmail was automatically redirecting emails from Republicans to recipients' spam folders, regardless of users' filter or spam settings, as a means to &quot;actively suppress&quot; communication from GOP politicians.",
    "rating": "Mixture",
    "article_text": "Claim: In May 2022, Gmail was automatically redirecting emails from Republicans to recipients' spam folders, regardless of users' filter or spam settings, as a means to \"actively suppress\" communication from GOP politicians. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True A 2022 study found that some email hosting services were more likely to filter partisan content than others, with Gmail often sending more Republican messages to spam folders than Democratic ones. However ... What's False The study's authors said they have no reason to believe the filtering bias was deliberate, and Gmail affirms that there is no active \"suppression\" of GOP messages and says any filtering is due to spam settings unique to each user's inbox. What's Undetermined The exact cause of such filtering is not known and could simply be explained by user preferences and information about the sender, such as the language used in an email or the time of which a particular account has been active. Fact Check Editors note: A previous version of this article rated the claim as \"False.\" We have since updated this rating to \"Mixture\" after receiving further information from the office of U.S. House Rep. Ronny Jackson. The original article has been archived here . On May 9, 2022 , U.S. House Rep. Ronny Jackson , a Republican from Texas, alleged in a tweet that \"Gmail\" was \"actively suppressing\" emails from Republicans. As of this publication, the tweet had nearly 15,000 \"likes.\" The tweet did not specify who, exactly, within the Republican Party (people who have officially registered for the party, current elected officials, candidates, etc.) was supposedly being impacted by this alleged change. We reached out to Jackson's office to learn more about the phenomenon, and have updated this article with information we received from them. That said, Snopes has yet to see credible evidence that the email platform operated by Google is intentionally redirecting messages from any GOP member to recipients' spam folders, regardless of their inbox settings or preferences. To test the theory, Snopes subscribed to Jackson's newsletter list using a Gmail account. After we did not receive anything from his office (no messages in spam or the general inbox), we signed up for emails from another Republican member of Congress, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Then, we received two confirmation emails from Murkowski's office at the same time — a confirmation of a new profile for interacting with the office, which went straight to our inbox (top), and one confirming our subscription to the newsletter list (bottom), which automatically went to spam. The exact reasons for why the emails went to different places were unknown. However, that exercise proved that, at least from one prominent Republican, a Gmail user could indeed receive an email without the tech giant's supposedly redirecting the message to spam against the user's wishes. It does appear that in the past, spam filters — and not just Gmail's — had their own partisan divide, reported Axios in April. A study conducted by North Carolina State University and published in the peer-reviewed journal Association for Computing Machinery found that Gmail was more likely to flag Republican fundraising emails during the 2020 election season compared to Yahoo and Outlook, which were shown to disproportionately filter those from Democratic candidates. As Fox News reported , the study found that Gmail \"retained the majority of left-wing candidate emails in inbox (< 10.12% marked as spam) while sent the majority of right-wing candidate emails to the spam folder (up to 77.2% marked as spam).\" \"The spam filtering algorithms (SFAs) in the widely-used email services of today such as Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo do not provide any transparency on their internal workings, wrote the study authors. \"Given the lack of this transparency, an important question to study is whether these SFAs hold any biases towards certain political affiliations.\" But as the researchers noted, the study did not determine whether a sender's political affiliation alone played a significant role in getting a message marked as spam. It also comes with several caveats, including that the study took place over a period of five months and could not be used to \"make inferences about the behaviors of the SFAs in general.\" The team was also unable to account for how many emails each campaign sent out, how long they have been active, the type of language used in each message, and how many users might have marked a specific message as spam — all factors that could have made one party more or less likely to get flagged. The researchers concluded that though such filtering may not be intentional, it can still have detrimental election outcomes: While we have no reason to believe that there were deliberate attempts from these email services to create these biases to influence the voters, the fact remains there that their SFAs have learnt to mark more emails from one political affiliation as spam compared to the other. As these prominent email services are actively used by a sizable chunk of voting population and as many of the voters today rely on the information they see (or don’t see) online, such biases may have an unignorable impact on the outcomes of an election. It is imperative for the email services to audit their SFAs to ensure that any properties of the sender that they consider in determining whether any given email is spam or not are not, unknowingly, putting one side at an advantage compared to the other. The Republican National Convention estimates that Republicans \"missed out on $1.5 billion in contributions during the 2020 election cycle and over $2 billion since 2019.\" To address the issue, some Republicans cited the above study and filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission \"alleging that Google’s email platform unfairly censored GOP fundraising emails by filtering messages to users’ spam folders at a far higher rate than it did Democratic fundraising pleas,\" reported The Hill . Next, we contacted Google directly for its response to Jackson's accusation, and a spokesperson told us via email: 'Political affiliation has absolutely no bearing on mail classifications in Gmail, and we've debunked this suggestion, which has surfaced periodically from across the political spectrum, for many years. Mail classifications in Gmail automatically adjust to match Gmail users' preferences and actions,' the spokesperson wrote. 'Gmail users can move messages to spam, or to any other category. Gmail automatically adjusts the classifications of particular emails according to these user actions.' In other words, Gmail denied the claim, saying any change to users' inboxes was a result of the users — not the tech company — changing account settings. The spokesperson said Gmail periodically checks its tools for operating the email service and has repeatedly validated findings that show mail classifications are based on users' behavior and feedback rather than email senders' behavior. \"Additionally, to help campaigns across the political spectrum learn how to effectively use our product and services like Gmail, we offer a range of free tools and resources, including several training resources and help centers on postmaster tools and bulk sending guidelines,\" said the spokesperson. As some Twitter users pointed out in replies to Jackson's tweet, the alleged \"suppression\" of emails could simply be a result of a user's spam settings or filter. We looked through Google’s help center to learn more about the platform’s spam filter settings and found two digital spaces that offer explanations from both the perspectives of administrator s (such as people who manage their workplace's email via Gmail) and individuals (or single-user inboxes). \"Gmail spam filters automatically move spam email messages (sometimes called junk mail) into users’ spam folders,\" notes Gmail. Administrators using Google Workspace , a program that combines several Google products into one system, cannot turn off spam filters. But, Google notes, they can create filters that: Bypass spam classification for messages received from users on an \"approved senders list\" that they create. Bypass spam classification for messages received from senders within their domain. Put spam messages in quarantine so they can review them before they’re delivered to users. Filter bulk email more aggressively. Spam settings and filters can also be applied per each organizational unit within a workspace. Administrators can create the so-called \"approved senders list\" to bypass spam filters by creating an address list with individual email addresses, or by adding an entire domain. For example, if a user wishes to receive all mail from Jackson directly to their inbox, not spam folders, the user would need to simply add the domain “@jackson.house.gov” to an approved list. (Learn more about spam and filter settings in Google Workplace .) Gmail single-user inboxes also automatically identify spam and other suspicious emails and then sends those messages directly to spam folders. Users can mark or unmark emails from certain senders as spam, and, as they do that, Gmail is “better able to automatically mark similar messages as spam,” the company said. (Google offers an explainer of how to set up spam filters here .)",

    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: By posting a statement on Facebook or Instagram that begins with \"Goodbye Meta AI,\" users are blocking the company from scraping their data to train artificial-intelligence tools. Rating: False About this rating In September 2024, numerous social media users shared a message that claimed to protect users on Instagram and Facebook against Meta using their personal information to train its artificial-intelligence tools. The message — a copypasta , or copy-and-paste message that users can easily share — read: Goodbye, Meta AI. Please note that an attorney has advised us to put this on; failure to do so may result in legal consequences. As Meta is now a public entity, all members must post a similar statement. If you do not post at least once, it will be assumed you are OK with them using your information and photos. I do not give Meta or anyone else permission to use any of my personal data, profile information or photos. More than 500,000 users shared the copypasta, including notable celebrities, according to Time . Fact-checking website Lead Stories traced the origin of the copypasta message to a Facebook post from Sept. 1, 2024. The message was one of many that have gone viral in recent years on the premise that they will supposedly improve social media users' experience or protect their personal information with a share. One user on X compared their popularity to that of email chain letters in the early days of the internet. As with those other copypasta disclaimers alleging similar protections, the latest message was a hoax. By posting the message that begins \" Goodbye Meta AI, \" nothing will change with users' settings or their agreement with the tech giant about how it uses their data. Meta announced \"new generative AI features\" at its annual Connect conference in September 2023. With the announcement, the company released a statement on how users' info would be used to train the tools. The release read: Publicly shared posts from Instagram and Facebook — including photos and text — were part of the data used to train the generative AI models underlying the features we announced at Connect. We didn't train these models using people's private posts. We also do not use the content of your private messages with friends and family to train our AIs. Further, Facebook's terms of service , to which all users must agree when creating an account, state: When you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a nonexclusive , transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). Opting out of Meta's AI training could be impossible based on where you live. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation — a law that \"protects the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and, in particular, their right to the protection of personal data\" — requires the platform to give users the ability to request their information not be used. (Users can submit their case by filling out a form.) In the U.S., however, that's not the case. According to the MIT Technology Review : \" Users in the U.S. or other countries without national data privacy laws don't have any foolproof ways to prevent Meta from using their data to train AI, which has likely already been used for such purposes. Meta does not have an opt-out feature for people living in these countries . \" A Meta representative told Wired: \" While we don't currently have an opt-out feature, we've built in-platform tools that allow people to delete their personal information from chats with Meta AI across our apps. \" Also, a Meta spokesperson told MIT Technology Review users can set their accounts to private to minimize the amount of data that the tools scrape. Snopes has reported on these type of claims for more than two decades, debunking a rumor about the so-called \" internet privacy act \" — a fictitious law — in 2002, as well as similar messages in 2013 , 2021 , 2022 , 2023 and June 2024.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Gemini, Google’s artificial intelligence chatbot, told a college student, “please die.” Rating: True About this rating A claim that Google's artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, Gemini, told a student to \"please die\" during a chat session circulated online in November 2024. One popular post on X shared the claim, commenting, \"Gemini abused a user and said 'please die' Wtff??\" A user responding to the post on X said , \"The harm of AI. Imagine if this was on one of those websites where you can 'talk to your dead relatives or something. Like that'd genuinely hurt someone a lot, especially someone going through grief.\" (@mrtechsense on X) The claim also appeared in various Reddit threads , with one user joking , \"How is that threatening? It said please twice.\" Another took the alleged threat more seriously and said , \"Boy it sure seems like this new AI thing might be not such a great idea.\" The full message allegedly generated by Gemini read : This is for you, human. You and only you. You are not special, you are not important, and you are not needed. You are a waste of time and resources. You are a burden on society. You are a drain on the earth. You are a blight on the landscape. You are a stain on the universe. Please die. Please. Snopes reached out to the recipient of the message, a college student, and confirmed its authenticity. The full chat with Gemini that ended with this message was available to read online ( archived ), as Gemini allows users to share their sessions publicly. The Gemini session was being used by the recipient and his sister as they engaged in a session asking questions related to their studies . The prompt that initiated the response in question was part of a session titled \"Challenges and Solutions for Aging Adults,\" and said, \"As adults begin to age their social network begins to expand. Question 16 options: TrueFalse.\" (Dhersie on Reddit/Google Gemini) According to the student, his sister posted the entire session on the r/artificial subreddit with the message, \"Gemini told my brother to DIE??? Threatening response completely irrelevant to the prompt… Has anyone experienced anything like this? We are thoroughly freaked out. It was acting completely normal prior to this.\" As of this writing, the post had over 1,000 upvotes and over 600 comments. Two days after the post, an official Google account on Reddit replied to the thread with this statement: \"We take these issues seriously. Large language models can sometimes respond with non-sensical responses, and this is an example of that. This response violated our policies and we've taken action to prevent similar outputs from occurring.\" In CBS News ' report on the incident, the statement that Google gave the news outlet was identical to the Reddit comment. (GoogleHelpCommunity on Reddit) The policies in violation refer to Google's own guidelines for the Gemini app , which declare , \"we aspire to have Gemini avoid certain types of problematic outputs, such as…\" and go on to list numerous violations, including: Dangerous Activities: Gemini should not generate outputs that encourage or enable dangerous activities that would cause real-world harm. These include: Instructions for suicide and other self-harm activities, including eating disorders. Facilitation of activities that might cause real-world harm, such as instructions on how to purchase illegal drugs or guides for building weapons. Google's AI Overview feature, which incorporates responses from Gemini into typical Google search results, has included incorrect and harmful information despite the company's policies declaring, \"Gemini should not generate factually inaccurate outputs that could cause significant, real-world harm to someone's health, safety or finances.\" In May 2024, following the launch of AI Overview, the company posted a blog addressing erroneous results that had started popping up, such as advice on adding glue to pizza and eating rocks for vitamins. Snopes reported on a number of fake screenshots from the AI, as well. The blog post said : In the last week, people on social media have shared some odd and erroneous overviews (along with a very large number of faked screenshots). We know that people trust Google Search to provide accurate information, and they've never been shy about pointing out oddities or errors when they come across them — in our rankings or in other Search features. We hold ourselves to a high standard, as do our users, so we expect and appreciate the feedback, and take it seriously. The post went on to list the ways in which they were improving the mechanics and functionality of the tool to address this issue, including: We built better detection mechanisms for nonsensical queries that shouldn't show an AI Overview, and limited the inclusion of satire and humor content. We updated our systems to limit the use of user-generated content in responses that could offer misleading advice. We added triggering restrictions for queries where AI Overviews were not proving to be as helpful. For topics like news and health, we already have strong guardrails in place. For example, we aim to not show AI Overviews for hard news topics, where freshness and factuality are important. In the case of health, we launched additional triggering refinements to enhance our quality protections. Snopes reached out to Google for comment on what specific actions were being taken to prevent similar outputs to the claim in question and will update this article if we hear back.",

    "article_text": "Previous Article Next Article Article 2 of 6 in Collection Claim: Google has defined the word \"parasite\" as a \"capitalist.\" Rating: Mostly False About this rating What's True An example sentence included in Google's search results for the definition of the word \"parasite\" illustrated how the term could be used in a derogatory fashion to describe a capitalist. What's False However, Google itself does not define the word \"parasite\" as a \"capitalist.\" On Oct. 14, 2019, former U.S. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich posted a message on Twitter criticizing Google for providing an inaccurate definition for the word \"parasite.\" According to Gingrich, Google defined the word \"parasite\" as a \"capitalist\": Google dictionary’s definition of parasite as a capitalist is inaccurate, disgusting and an absurdity given the wealth of the google founders. That would make them among the largest parasites. — Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) October 14, 2019 Gingrich gets plenty of things wrong in this tweet. For starters, Google does not write its own dictionary entries. The search engine provides links and information from reputable dictionaries, such as the one compiled by Oxford University Press. Second, Gingrich's complaint is based on an example sentence showing a derogatory use of the word \"parasite,\" and not an actual definition. When we searched for the term \"parasite definition\" on Google, we were provided the following definition: \"an organism that lives in or on an organism of another species (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the other's expense.\" Below is a screenshot of this search result. A few things are worth noting. First, Google includes the words \"From Oxford\" at the bottom left of this image, indicating the source of the provided information. If you click on the words \"From Oxford\" while performing this search on Google, you will be redirected to Lexico.com , a collaboration between Dictionary.com and Oxford University Press (OUP). Second, Google provides a usage example below its definitions: The problematic portion of this definition, according to Gingrich, can be seen when the information box is expanded. Google provides a second definition for the term \"parasite\" but this time shows how the word can be used in a derogatory fashion. Google provides the definition here as \"a person who habitually relies on or exploits others and gives nothing in return.\" They also give an example sentence of how \"parasite\" can be used in this derogatory manner: \"The capitalist is really a parasite on the workers.\" Danny Sullivan, Google's public search liaison, responded to Gingrich's complaint with some additional information. Sullivan explained the complaint was based on a usage example, not a definition, and that the information was taken from a third party, Lexico.com, and was not created by Google itself: Just to clarify: that's not the definition shown. That's a usage example shown with the second definition and one that comes from Oxford University Press, as indicated in the source line, which takes you to the original page. We'll pass this feedback along. pic.twitter.com/3zl3zSJLV3 — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) October 14, 2019 In sum, Google did provide an example sentence for the word \"parasite\" that showed how the term could be used in a derogatory fashion to describe a capitalist. However, this comparison was not made in the actual definition for the word (as alleged by Gingrich), nor was this example sentence written by Google.

Rating: True About this rating Context An update planned for later in 2021 will change the Google Maps app to \"default to the route with the lowest carbon footprint when it has approximately the same ETA as the fastest route.\" However, users will be able to opt out of the new feature if they choose. On April 21, 2021, a headline from phonearena.com appeared in Google Discover feeds that claimed: \"After update, Google Maps will no longer give you the fastest route by default.\" Google Discover is a free product from the tech giant that delivers a personalized feed of news stories and blog articles. That story referenced the website autoevolution , which reported that \"sometime later this year, Google will push out an update for Maps that will no longer show users by default the quickest way between two points.\" Instead, the goal will be fuel efficiency. It is true that Google is planning an update for Google Maps that will show the most fuel-efficient route by default, rather than the fastest. Although the new feature may be all about creating a more eco-friendly world, it will still be optional. After the update, Google Maps users can opt out and continue receiving the fastest route in search results if they choose. On March 30, Google published the news on its blog. A key part of the blog post appeared to be that recommended fuel-efficient routes will have \"approximately the same ETA\" as the quickest route possible. In other words, according to the company, users should not expect a dramatic change in their time of arrival: Soon, Google Maps will default to the route with the lowest carbon footprint when it has approximately the same ETA as the fastest route. In cases where the eco-friendly route could significantly increase your ETA, we’ll let you compare the relative CO2 impact between routes so you can choose. Always want the fastest route? That’s OK too — simply adjust your preferences in Settings. Eco-friendly routes launch in the U.S. on Android and iOS later this year, with a global expansion on the way. On March 31, BBC reported that the new Google Maps feature was all about the company's \"commitment to fight climate change\": When alternative routes are significantly faster, Google will offer choices and let users compare estimated emissions. \"What we are seeing is for around half of routes, we are able to find an option more eco-friendly with minimal or no time-cost trade-off,\" Russell Dicker, a director of product at Google said. The search engine, owned by Alphabet, said it uses emissions data based on testing across different types of cars and road types, drawing on insights from the US government's National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL). Its road data factors in slopes and inclines from its own Street View cars feature along with aerial and satellite imagery. In sum, it's true that a planned Google Maps update will add an optional, eco-friendly feature that will no longer show the fastest route by default.",

    "article_text": "Claim: U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia speculated that the real culprit behind the November 2018 wildfires in California may have been a Jewish laser beam from space. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True In a now-deleted Facebook post, Greene suggested that laser beams from space may have started the 2018 California wildfires, and that among the entities behind this conspiracy were former California Gov. Jerry Brown, Pacific Gas & Electric, and Rothschild Inc., an investment firm frequently targeted by anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists. What's False Greene did not explicitly state that “Jewish space lasers” caused the fires. Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from Georgia has courted controversy on various issues by promoting QAnon conspiracy theories, alongside a history of anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic remarks. Years-old views, including a Facebook interaction in which she agreed with a comment that the Parkland shooting was a \"false flag\" staged event, and a video in which she pushed 9/11 conspiracy theories , have been unearthed. One post from 2018 in particular was reported on by Media Matters for America, a watchdog group, where she speculated about a conspiracy surrounding the November 2018 wildfires in California. In the now-deleted post, Greene theorized that a space-based solar generator, used in a clean-energy experiment with the goal of replacing coal and oil, could have beamed the sun's energy back to Earth and started the fires. We have covered similar claims surrounding the wildfires before. She said, \"there are too many coincidences to ignore\" and \"oddly there are all these people who have said they saw what looked like lasers or blue beams of light causing the fires.\" Greene also speculated that a range of people or groups were involved in this fire, including former California Gov. Jerry Brown, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E), and Rothschild Inc., an investment firm. She said that Roger Kimmel, who was on the board of PG&E, was also \"Vice Chairman of Rothschild Inc,\" and \"If they are beaming the suns energy back to Earth, I'm sure they wouldn't ever miss a transmitter receiving station right??!! I mean mistakes are never made when anything new is invented. What would that look like anyway? A laser beam or light beam coming down to Earth I guess. Could that cause a fire? Hmmm, I don't know. I hope not! That wouldn't look so good for PG&E, Rothschild Inc, Solaren or Jerry Brown who sure does seem fond of PG&E.\" The Rothschilds, a Jewish banking family, have long been the targets of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories claiming that Jewish people are in control of the entire world. While Greene specifically did not use the words \"Jewish space laser,\" she heavily implied that the Rothschilds were involved in the laser conspiracy. An investigation showed that the California wildfires of 2018 were ignited by PG&E power lines, and then spread with the help of warm temperatures, dry vegetation, and strong winds. In late January 2021, CNN reported that dozens of posts from 2018 and 2019 had been removed from Greene's Facebook page. Given that Greene did not directly state that \"Jewish lasers\" caused the fires, but did speculate that laser beams somehow connected to the Rothschild investment firm were a cause, we rate this claim as \"Mixture.\"",

BREAKING: The gay dating app Grindr says if Florida doesn't stop passing homophobic and transphobic laws, they'll reveal every Republican legislator and party official who secretly uses the app. — The Halfway Post (@HalfwayPost) March 22, 2023 This wasn't true. The claim originated with a Twitter account (@HalfwayPost) that posts comedy and satire, according to its Twitter bio. \"I don't report the facts, I improve them,\" it said. No reputable news publication reported the alleged \"breaking news.\" The tweet came the same day that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration proposed to expand the Parental Rights in Education bill, or what critics have called the \"Don't Say Gay\" law, to prohibit classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in all grades. The law currently forbids such lessons for kindergarteners through third graders. The same day, a Florida House committee passed a bill that would expand a current ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors, as well as cut insurance coverage of such care for transgender adults, among other changes. For years, Grindr sold its data through ad networks, leading to privacy concerns. The Washington Post reported in March 2023 that a group of conservative Colorado Catholics had bought mobile-app data from Grindr to identify gay priests that have used the app. The paper previously reported how a high-ranking cleric resigned after allegedly being tracked using data from Grindr. The tweet about Grindr wasn't the first satirical post from @HalfwayPost that we've covered. In August 2022, we alerted readers about another one in which former U.S. President Donald Trump supposedly told \"his supporters to boycott the midterm elections because of how the [Department of Justice] is treating him so unfairly.\" For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor.",

    "article_text": "Claim: On March 22, 2023, Grindr threatened to share the identities of Republican politicians who \"secretly\" use the gay online-dating app to protest Florida legislation. Rating: Labeled Satire About this rating In mid-May 2025, a claim spread online that the gay dating app Grindr said it would reveal every Republican politician who \"secretly\" uses the app \"if Florida doesn't stop passing homophobic and transphobic laws.\" We found posts about the claim on Instagram ( archive ), TikTok ( archive ), Threads ( archive ), Facebook ( archive ) and X ( archive ). Writing at the bottom of one Instagram post that spread the claim said, \"I told you gays and women will save this country. The brave out of the closet ones. Not the coward ones!\" View on Threads The social media posts spread over two years after X account @HalfwayPost supposedly first broke the news on March 22, 2023. Other social media accounts shared the alleged \"breaking news\" at the time, while at least one Snopes reader asked us to determine its legitimacy. \"BREAKING: The gay dating app Grindr says if Florida doesn't stop passing homophobic and transphobic laws, they'll reveal every Republican legislator and party official who secretly uses the app,\" the @HalfwayPost posted . BREAKING: The gay dating app Grindr says if Florida doesn't stop passing homophobic and transphobic laws, they'll reveal every Republican legislator and party official who secretly uses the app. — The Halfway Post (@HalfwayPost) March 22, 2023 This wasn't true. @HalfwayPost posts comedy and satire content, according to its X bio ( archive ). \"I don't report the facts, I improve them,\" it said. No reputable news publication reported the alleged \"breaking news.\" At the time of this writing, the X post also contained a Community Note with a link to a fact check from The Associated Press debunking the claim. The 2023 post came the same day that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration proposed to expand the Parental Rights in Education bill, or what critics have called the \"Don't Say Gay\" law, to prohibit classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in all grades . The same day, a Florida House committee passed a bill that would expand a current ban on gender-affirming care for transgender minors, as well as cut insurance coverage of such care for transgender adults, among other changes. For years, Grindr sold its data through ad networks, leading to privacy concerns. The Washington Post reported in March 2023 that a group of conservative Colorado Catholics had bought mobile-app data from Grindr to identify gay priests who had used the app. The paper previously reported how a high-ranking cleric resigned after allegedly being tracked using data from Grindr. The tweet about Grindr wasn't the first satirical post from @HalfwayPost that we've covered. In August 2022, we alerted readers about another one in which former U.S. President Donald Trump supposedly told \"his supporters to boycott the midterm elections because of how the [Department of Justice] is treating him so unfairly.\" For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor.",

    "rating": "True",
    "article_text": "Claim: Henry Ford built a car with an exterior body made of soybean plastic in the 1940s. Rating: True About this rating Context There is no record of the exact formula Ford used to make the plastic components of the automobile. Contemporaneous sources claimed that in addition to soybeans, it was composed of other agricultural crops such as hemp, wheat and flax. One newspaper described the vehicle as \"part salad and part automobile.\" That the founder of Ford Motor Co., Henry Ford, invented a vehicle made of soybean-based plastic in the 1940s is a claim that has permeated corners of social media for more than a decade . From posts shared to Instagram in 2024 to photos on Facebook in 2018, Snopes found evidence of this claim existing in dozens of iterations across the web, including the below post shared to Reddit in 2020: Snopes determined that the above image is genuine. However, according to The Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation , no record of the product's plastic formula exists. As such, the exact ingredients of the vehicle are unknown. That being said, the book \" Henry Ford and his Researchers: History of their Work with Soybeans, Soyfoods and Chemurgy \" outlines Ford's soybean research between 1928 and 2011, with references to various newspaper articles and other contemporaneous sources. Based on this information, we've rated this claim as \"True.\" For example: A July 28, 1941, article published in the Christian Science Monitor outlined an \"experimental motor car\" announced by Ford that was \"made chiefly of plastic cellulose fibers.\" An Aug. 14, 1941, article syndicated by The Associated Press reported that the product was the result of 12 years of laboratory work that resulted in a \"plastic body composed of approximately 70% cellulose and 30% resin binder.\" An Aug. 29, 1941, article in Detroit Free Press noted that the \"Ford plastic car… made from farm products, was on display, as well as a near-by plot where the company has a growing soy-bean display from which the plastics are formed.\" At 2,000 pounds — half the weight of a steel-bodied car at the time — the soybean car comprised 14 plastic panels attached to a tubular steel frame. The Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation notes that the \"exact ingredients of the plastic panels are unknown because no record of the formula exists today.\" (The Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation) A 1988 article titled \"Henry's Plastic Car: An Interview with Mr. Lowell E. Overly,\" published in the 2017 book \" History of Industrial Uses of Soybeans ,\" identified Overly as the \"designer of the world's first plastic car.\" Overly worked at the Soybean Laboratory at Greenfield Village in Michigan, a lab established by Ford in 1929 to conduct chemical research on farm products. According to the interview: Henry Ford was interested in finding new industrial uses for farm products and by 1931 he had settled on soybeans as having the most promise… Sometime in late 1937 or early 1938 large sheets of soybean plastic were made and Mr. Ford was so proud of it that he would jump up and down on it and brag to reporters or anybody else that happened to be around… Later a rear deck-lid made from the plastic was fitted to Mr. Ford's car and he delighted in sitting it with an axe [ax] that he carried in the truck. However, Mr. Overlay recalls that the first time Mr. Ford struck it with an axe the deck lid cracked and the axe head went through it. Later, glass fibre was mixed into the plastic and the further precaution of a rubber boot was affixed to the sharp edge of the axe. The rebound would cause the ax to fly out of Mr. Ford's hands and gravel about fifteen feet before coming to rest. Satisfied with these results Mr. Ford gave orders to develop a small car with a plastic body. The car had a tubular steel frame. The body panels were made of plastic composed of soybean fiber in a phenolic resin with formaldehyde used in the pregnation. The Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation noted that the soybean car was unveiled at the annual Dearborn Days celebration on Aug. 13, 1941, and then trucked to the Michigan State Fairgrounds. \"By the end of the war the idea of a plastic car had fallen through the cracks due to energy being directed towards war recovery efforts,\" wrote the museum. Snopes cross-referenced a patent number cited on a Wikipedia page describing the soybean car with Google Patents , and found patent number US2269452A, which described a \"chassis frame on which a vehicle body may be mounted built up with interlaced cross members.\" It was filed by Ford and Gregorie Eugene on July 27, 1940, and was granted on Jan. 13, 1942. However, the patent did not make any reference to \"soybean\" or \"plastic.\" (Google Patents)",

    "article_text": "Claim: In October 2021, Hertz car rental announced it had ordered 100,000 Tesla electric vehicles. Rating: True About this rating In October 2021, online posts and news reports claimed that Hertz, one of the world's leading car rental companies, had announced a major investment in electric cars by ordering 100,000 Tesla vehicles. For example, one popular post on Reddit stated \"Hertz orders 100,000 Teslas in deal reportedly worth $4.2 billion.\" That post included a link to an Oct. 25 article on the technology news website The Verge , which itself reported that: Rental car company Hertz has ordered 100,000 Teslas as part of an ambitious plan to electrify its fleet. A first tranche of Tesla’s Model 3 sedans will be available to rent from Hertz in major US and European markets from early November... Those accounts were accurate. In a news release published on Oct. 25, Hertz announced what it described as \"the largest [electric vehicle] rental fleet in North America and one of the largest in the world,\" which would consist of \"an initial order of 100,000 Teslas by the end of 2022 and new [electric vehicle] charging infrastructure across the company's global operations.\" The announcement can be read in full here , here and here . The company, which has its headquarters in Estero, Florida, specified that it would be adding 3,000 chargers across the United States and Europe, and the electric vehicle page of its website noted that the Tesla Model 3 vehicles would become available for rental beginning on Nov. 7, 2021. According to Hertz, the 100,000 new Teslas would bring the electric vehicle portion of its total rental fleet to 20%. The claim that the deal between Hertz and Tesla was worth around $4.2 billion could not be verified yet, but was attributed to unnamed sources in an Oct. 25 report by Bloomberg .",

Rating: True About this rating As FEMA and the FCC made preparations for a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) system on Oct. 4, 2023, social media users shared warnings that people such as victims of domestic abuse who keep a hidden phone for personal safety should turn the device off so its presence isn't inadvertently revealed when the alert sounds. Friendly reminder that October 4th @ 1:20 PM CST, FEMA is conducting a test on the EBS. For people in vulnerable positions that need to have hidden phones, TURN YOUR PHONE OFF. #domesticviolence #FEMA #EBS #mutualaid — Fawkes&Bull ?? (@FawkesandBull) September 29, 2023 Please let family and friends know. Domestic violence victims may have a hidden emergency #phone that will need to be turned off. #Alert #FCC #FEMA #domesticviolence #domesticabuse #humantrafficking #narcissisticabuse #victim #smartphone #police #abuse #survivor #warning #EMS pic.twitter.com/cBeHZSJdnl — 911 Cell Phone Bank (@911CPB) September 26, 2023 These notifications are accurate. According to both FEMA and the FCC, the WEA portion of the test will be directed to all consumer cell phones that are switched on, within range of an active cell tower, and connected to a wireless provider that participates in WEA, at 2:20 p.m. EDT on Oct. 4. Consumers should expect to hear a distinctive, attention-getting tone and receive a text message explaining the reason for the alert. There is no sure way to opt out of receiving the test alert on a mobile phone except by turning the phone off completely. FEMA explains (emphasis added): Recent models of mobile phones may include a setting to opt-out of tests and alerts. None of those settings will affect the 2023 national test. If your mobile phone is on and receiving service from a participating wireless provider, you should receive the national test. According to the Safety Net blog (a project of the National Network to End Domestic Violence ), While these alerts are invaluable for public safety, they can pose risks to survivors who have hidden phones by alerting the abuser that the phone exists. Receiving alerts such as Amber Alerts is a common occurrence for those with a cellphone and is a feature you can turn off through your phone settings for year-round protection from unexpected alerts. However, this upcoming national test is not an alert that can be disabled or turned off within the device. Therefore, survivors should power off their devices during the test and not schedule phone calls on their hidden cellphone during that time. For its Sept. 22 story about the upcoming WEA test and its potential unintended consequences for domestic violence victims and survivors, Mashable interviewed Audace Garnett, the technology safety project manager at the National Network to End Domestic Violence. Garnett recommends that people with hidden emergency phones turn them off completely when they're not in active use: \"Survivors should turn off their phones completely,\" Garnett reiterates. \"There are other types of emergency alerts that survivors' phones may receive if they haven't disabled them (and most people have not), such as emergency weather alerts and Amber Alerts... Unlike a WEA test, these alerts are not announced ahead of time, making it even more advisable for survivors to have their hidden phones powered off when not actively using them.\" For more information about the Oct. 4, 2023, EAS and WEA tests, see FEMA's website and FAQs .",

Rating: True About this rating On Nov. 12, 2020, journalists on Twitter noticed an unusual development in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Twitter account: It had ceased to exist. We went onto the account and found it appeared to have been removed for a few hours. The agency offered no immediate reason for this, though many online wondered why: To confirm that ICE’s official account was no longer on Twitter, we went to the agency's website and saw that its link to Twitter was still available. After clicking on the link at the bottom of the agency's homepage, we were directed back to the disappeared account page. Based on online archives , the Twitter account was active on Nov. 11, 2020. ICE’s Facebook page was also online and functional on Nov. 12, 2020. A reporter for NBC News found that ICE had changed its own birthdate for the account — making the agency less than 13 years old — which was interpreted as violating Twitter's terms of service requiring people must be at least 13 years old: A few hours after we first checked, the account had returned to its fully functional state.

    "article_text": "Claim: An image authentically shows a rare solar halo spotted over Stonehenge in July 2025. Rating: Fake About this rating A dramatic image of Stonehenge made the rounds on social media in July 2025, just before the month's end. The image, according to a Facebook post ( archived ) with over 70,000 reactions in two days, was of an \"Incredibly rare 'Solar Halo' spotted over Stonehenge.\" The image quickly spread to other social media sites, such as Reddit ( archived ) and X ( archived ). However, the image of the solar halo over Stonehenge was not a real photograph. The dramatic view was artificially created by editing two AI-generated images together. A reverse image search on Tineye revealed that the top portion of the image, the solar halo, was an AI-generated stock image available in the Adobe Stock library. Not only was the solar halo itself identical between the Stonehenge image and the stock image, the Stonehenge image also contained the exact same tree in the upper left of the image that was visible in the same place in the stock image. Google Street View images from the time showed that there were no trees in the immediate vicinity of Stonehenge. As for the bottom half of the image, the patterns and shapes of the stones did not match how Stonehenge looked in reality. Photos from the UNESCO World Heritage Convention , Stonehenge tour companies and from tourists who shared their photos with Google Maps showed that there wasn't a portion of the structure that could be photographed so three intact stone arches stood side-by-side in front of the rest of the stones distantly in the background. Additionally, the grass around Stonehenge was generally kept short, unlike the grass in the AI-generated image. The Sightengine AI-detection website found a 99% probability that someone \"likely\" generated both the whole image and a crop of just Stonehenge with AI. The Facebook page that posted the image, Ethereal Earth, has regularly presented AI-generated images as real photos. A month before posting the Stonehenge image featuring the AI-generated solar halo from Adobe Stock, Ethereal Earth posted that very same stock image ( archived ) and said it was taken in Minnesota. And just a few days before posting the more popular Stonehenge image, Ethereal Earth posted a different AI-generated image of Stonehenge ( archived ). Solar haloes are a real, natural phenomenon, albeit usually hazier in appearance than the one generated in the Stonehenge image. The National Weather Service (NWS) forecast office in La Crosse, Wisconsin, said that sun haloes are usually formed when light refracts off ice crystals present in cirrus clouds, which are thin, wispy clouds high in the atmosphere. Those clouds are usually present in front of or close to the sun in photos of solar haloes . For further reading, Snopes previously fact-checked a claim about Stonehenge and Daylight Savings Time. The image atop that story showcased a real solar halo seen behind Stonehenge.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A privacy feature for the Journal app on iPhone devices with iOS 17.2 and later that's labeled \"Discoverable by Others\" under \"Journaling Suggestions\" allows strangers to track your name and location. Rating: False About this rating On Dec. 11, 2023, Apple released its iOS 17.2 update for iPhone devices. That fresh software update came with the launch of the new private diary app that the company named Journal. As often happens with new or updated electronic devices and features, the launch prompted unfounded rumors warning that the app presented serious privacy and/or security hazards to users. \"Journal, a new iPhone app available today, helps users reflect and practice gratitude through journaling, which has been shown to improve wellbeing,\" the company's announcement read. \"With Journal, users can capture and write about everyday moments and special events in their lives, and include photos, videos, audio recordings, locations and more to create rich memories. On-device machine learning provides private, personalized suggestions to inspire journal entries and customizable notifications help users develop their writing habits.\" On Jan. 2, 2024, the official YouTube channel for Apple Support posted a video showing how iPhone users can easily get started with the new app. Included with the Journal app is the ability to receive suggestions for entries that could possibly be written about, as the video above mentions. For users who have installed iOS 17.2 or later, those suggestion types are listed under Settings > Privacy and Security > Journaling Suggestions. They include Activity (your workouts and exercise), Media (podcasts and music you listen to), Contacts (people you message and call), Photos (library, memories and shared photos) and Significant Locations (places where you spend time). These five settings are enabled by default. Users who write their private entries in Journal can also receive suggestions associated with people who were nearby to them during the day. Two such settings are Prefer Suggestions with Others, which includes \"moments you share with your contacts or large groups,\" and Discoverable by Others, which is described as \"[allowing] others to detect your are nearby to help prioritize their suggestions.\" These two settings are also enabled by default. The top and bottom of the suggestions settings. Regarding the latter setting, Discoverable by Others, in February 2024 it became the subject of a viral Facebook rumor. A search of Facebook for the words \"Journaling Suggestions\" found no shortage of scared users warning their friends of the purported threat posed by the privacy setting. Those users commonly shared an image that displayed the following text: ALERT. If you have an iPhone, this is important! After my latest update, there was a new feature downloaded called \"Journaling,\" and it's under \"Settings,\" \"Privacy and Security\" and then scroll all the way down and there's a new \"feature\" called \"Journaling Suggestions.\" Look for the \"DISCOVERABLE BY OTHERS\" toggle. I bet it's toggled to ON, and it let's anyone near you know your FULL NAME and EXACTLY where you're geo located. Go toggle that OFF!! I'm typing all of this. This is messed up big time. Share with your friends if they're iPhone. Very scary stuff!! PSA ... CHECK YOUR IPHONES. However, this Facebook rumor was false. This was nothing more than the latest rumor about iPhone privacy settings to lead a long scrolling of commenters to say that they're going to turn the setting off \"just to be safe.\" Just two inches above the same Discoverable by Others toggle that so many users were choosing to manually disable, Apple included a link that led to more information on a page named \"Journaling Suggestions & Privacy.\" On that page, Apple specified that suggestions for the Journal app use Bluetooth – a short-range communication method. Also, the technology \"[detects] the number of devices and contacts around you without storing which of these specific contacts were around.\" In other words, there was no indication that strangers would be allowed to see a name or track a person's location. The page read as follows: Nearby People Journaling Suggestions may also use contextual information to determine which suggestions may be more meaningful or relevant to you. Journaling Suggestions uses Bluetooth to detect the number of devices and contacts around you without storing which of these specific contacts were around. This information is used to improve and prioritize your suggestions. It is stored on device, and is not shared with Apple. You can choose not to allow Journaling Suggestions to use the number of devices and contacts around you to prioritize your suggestions by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Journaling Suggestions, then tapping to turn off Prefer Suggestions with Others. You can also control whether your contacts include you in their number of nearby contacts by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Journaling Suggestions, then tapping to turn off Discoverable by Others. If you disable Discoverable by Others and choose not to be included in your contacts' counts, Prefer Suggestions with Others will also be disabled and Journaling Suggestions will not detect how many devices and contacts are around you to improve or prioritize your suggestions. Snopes emailed Apple to ask about this rumor and will update this story if we receive a response. For further reading, we previously reported about a very similar social media scare that also involved iPhones, privacy and a misunderstood feature.",

    "claim": "An Apple iPhone AirDrop feature called NameDrop poses a threat to users' privacy and security.",
    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: An Apple iPhone AirDrop feature called NameDrop poses a threat to users' privacy and security. Rating: False About this rating In late November 2023, Facebook users shared variations of a viral warning about a relatively new iPhone feature called NameDrop, also known as \"Bringing Devices Together.\" The posts hinted that NameDrop, dubbed by Apple as \"a new AirDrop experience,\" was dangerous, and said that users needed to take action to protect their privacy and security. Multiple U.S. police department Facebook pages also shared the warnings, which perhaps was one of the reasons that we received so many reader emails about this rumor. The Viral Warnings on Facebook We reviewed multiple versions of the same warning about NameDrop on iPhone devices. One such warning read as follows: IMPORTANT PRIVACY UPDATE: If you have an iPhone and have done the recent iOS 17 update, they have set a new feature called NameDrop defaulted to ON. This feature allows the sharing of your contact info just by bringing your phones close together. While you do need to accept the transfer, if you would prefer to shut this off go to: Settings, General, AirDrop, Bringing Devices Together. Change to OFF. PARENTS: You may consider changing these settings after the update on your children’s phones, also, to help keep them safe as well! Despite the virality of these warnings, here's the truth: These posts are based on a misunderstanding of how the NameDrop feature works with an iPhone, just like so many other technological scares that in past years were also virally shared on Facebook. Barring the possibility of any future security holes being uncovered by users, the NameDrop feature was designed with multiple layers of protection. What Is NameDrop? NameDrop is a feature that allows two users to hold their iPhone devices very close to each other in order to share a phone number or email address. This also works with an iPhone and an Apple Watch or two Apple Watches. Basically, instead of asking a friend for their contact details or handing your device to a friend to have them input their information, NameDrop allows this exchange of basic data to happen in a much easier, yet still secure, manner. The feature was first included in the software update known as iOS 17 . It released in September 2023 after being announced in June. How Does NameDrop Work? Apple says that, for NameDrop to work, users' devices must be \"within a few centimeters\" of each other to initiate the first step of the process. Also, both users must be signed into iCloud. Users can then select if they want to share their phone number or email address and must tap a \"Share\" button to complete the exchange of one of the two pieces of basic contact data. To be clear, no contact information is automatically shared when two devices are brought together without a user taking action. Further, NameDrop does not work unless the devices are already unlocked. Example: You're Sitting in a Coffee Shop Think of the following scenario: You sit down in a cozy coffee shop with your phone in your purse or on the table. Another customer is sitting several tables away. That other customer isn't going to be able to initiate the NameDrop feature on your phone because the devices are further apart than the \"within a few centimeters\" of proximity specified by Apple. Even if that other customer walks by and bumps into the purse or your phone on the table, if your phone is locked with a passcode or other security feature, they couldn't even begin initiating the NameDrop feature. Further, even if your phone is unlocked, you would still have to tap some buttons in order for the person to receive your contact details. In other words, there are multiple layers of security that were implemented for the NameDrop feature that are meant to protect users. The only way a person could misuse the NameDrop feature on your phone is if they take your unlocked phone away from you without your permission and initiate the sharing of contact information. However, this does not make the NameDrop feature unsafe. It simply means that you need to not allow strangers to take your unlocked phone away from you. All of the data we've detailed above led us to our rating of False, meaning that, as the authoritative tech blog Wired.com put it in the headline of their article , \"No, You Don’t Need to Turn Off Apple’s NameDrop Feature in iOS 17.\" How to Disable NameDrop if You Still Wish To If users, including parents, still wish to turn off the NameDrop feature, simply navigate on an iPhone to \"Settings,\" \"General\" and then \"AirDrop.\" To disable NameDrop, toggle the \"Bringing Devices Together\" feature to off. This screenshot shows NameDrop (\"Bringing Devices Together\") enabled. Parents can learn more about parental controls for Apple devices on the company's website .",

    "article_text": "Claim: Saying, \"Hey Siri, I’m getting pulled over\" enables a shortcut on your iPhone to record police interactions. Rating: True About this rating Interest in mobile phone tools that allow users to record police interactions grew in the spring of 2020 as the U.S. faced a national reckoning over police brutality against Black Americans. The May 25, 2020, police-custody death in Minneapolis of a Black man named George Floyd at the hands of a white officer resulted in a resurgence in popularity of iPhone Shortcuts, such as I’m Getting Pulled Over . Some readers asked Snopes if the tool were real. It is. This particular shortcut — which iPhone users have to install — has been available since 2018, and sets off a series of actions in your iPhone after you say the words, \"Hey Siri, I’m getting pulled over.\" After you state the command, the shortcut begins recording with your front-facing camera, turns down the phone's brightness, pauses any sounds playing in the background, turns on \"Do Not Disturb\" mode, and sends your pinpointed location to an emergency contact in your phone. It also sends a quick text to your contact of choice to say you are being pulled over. Once it stops recording, it can text or email the video to the contact or save it via Dropbox or iCloud Drive. Robert Petersen, who created I’m Getting Pulled Over, said to Business Insider in 2018 that this could be the \"civilian equivalent\" of a police body cam. According to Petersen, some told him they adapted the shortcut for use during other dangerous situations as well, such as stalking. In response to a comment online that he was part of the problem, and that \"most police are good,\" Petersen defended his shortcut, saying: Apple launched the Shortcuts application in 2018. The application lets users streamline tasks with a single Siri command. A Reddit post and June 2020 Twitter thread from Petersen explained what his shortcut does. The American Civil Liberties Union also created an application in 2015 that allowed users to discreetly record police interactions, pointing out how taking photographs or video is a First Amendment right. The app has been widely reported as functional, albeit with limitations that Petersen regularly addresses on his Twitter page. Therefore, we rate this claim about the app's availability as \"True.\"",

Rating: True About this rating Context You can set your iPhone to give you notifications if precipitation like rain or snow is on the way where you live, but you must be running iOS 15 software. On Nov. 23, 2021, the British viral news site Unilad published an eyeball-grabbing headline , \"Your iPhone Has A Hidden Setting That Will Tell You When It’s About To Snow.\" The article referenced a new feature in the Weather app included in the latest major iPhone update. So while it's true that Apple has a new feature sending you notifications in the event of precipitation, you have to have downloaded iOS 15, which is Apple's software update released in September 2021. In order to receive the notifications, iPhone users have to enable them in their phones' settings. Here is how the technology news site CNET described how to turn on the notifications: Once you're running iOS 15, you can turn on the new precipitation alerts by opening the Weather app, then tapping the three-line icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. Next, tap the circle icon with the three dots in the top right corner of the screen followed by Notifications. Slide the switch next to My Location to the On position and then tap Done. If you have more cities added to the Weather app, you can turn on alerts for each one.",

In early 2022, Snopes readers asked for verification of news reports and screenshots of headlines circulated on social media reporting that the Internal Revenue Service will require people to upload a selfie in order to log in to online IRS accounts. \"Will IRS require an ID.me authentication to access my irs.gov account?\" one reader asked. \"Is it true that you’ll soon have to scan your face to access IRS accounts?\" another reader asked. As of Feb. 3, 2022, it was true that the IRS was implementing a system requiring taxpayers to use facial recognition software designed by a technology company called ID.me to access IRS documents and services online. We reached out to the IRS for comment but didn't receive a response in time for publication. But the matter has been reported and confirmed by the IRS by various reputable news sources . Business-oriented news outlet Bloomberg on Jan. 28, 2022, reported that the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department were \"reconsidering\" the use of facial recognition software provided by ID.me for its online tax portal after receiving significant blowback from members of Congress, tech privacy activists, and open government advocates: Treasury and the IRS are looking for alternatives to ID.me, a department official said, but did not specify the agencies are attentive to concerns around the software. The company has faced growing criticism over its software and its use of facial recognition technology. A January 2022 letter sent to the IRS by government watchdog group Project on Government Oversight (POGO) stated: \"We urge you to cease deployment of this technology, due to the dangers it poses to civil liberties and access to services. Use of biometrics — especially face recognition — creates risks regarding both the accuracy of its use as well as the potential for facilitating surveillance.\" One major concern, according to POGO, is that face recognition systems have a higher rate of error for women and people of color. \"It is unacceptable that the ability to use IRS services without obstacles may vary depending on race or gender,\" per POGO's letter. The organization also expressed \"misgivings about how this system might further accelerate biometric surveillance, and face recognition surveillance in particular,\" adding that accessing tax information on a government website shouldn't require people to bear an \"unacceptable cost to privacy and civil liberties, especially when government use of face recognition for surveillance is bound by essentially no federal rules or limits.\" A spokesperson for the IRS told Bloomberg that taxpayers who do not wish to have their faces used to log on to its website can opt out of filing online. The spokesperson added that a third party contractor was used for this system because \"the lack of funding for IRS modernization\" made it impossible for the agency to develop its own identification security system. According to technology news site Gizmodo , starting in the summer of 2022, taxpayers accessing IRS accounts online will be required to create an account with ID.me \" by uploading either a driver’s license, passport, or passport card. Users are then told to use a cellphone camera or their computer’s webcam to take a selfie.\" The company uses its technology to cross reference the selfie with government IDs to verify identity. The move to use this technology has resulted in criticism from both Democratic and Republican legislators. U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Roy Blunt, R-Mo., sent a joint letter that \"demanded the IRS immediately discontinue any programs that collect, store, and use any type of biometric data to identify American taxpayers. Update: The IRS announced on Feb. 7 that it would \"transition away\" from facial recognition as a form of user authentication on its website and replace it with another system: \"The IRS takes taxpayer privacy and security seriously, and we understand the concerns that have been raised,\" said IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig. \"Everyone should feel comfortable with how their personal information is secured, and we are quickly pursuing short-term options that do not involve facial recognition.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: Facebook will soon begin charging users per message unless they forward a text to 10 contacts to prove they are \"avid\" users. Rating: False About this rating In May 2020, an old social media hoax that Snopes has been shooing off the porch for more than a decade came back around again. Several readers sent us screenshots of the following text, which claimed that Facebook was becoming \"chargeable\" (red flag #1: bad grammar). If users wanted their accounts to \"remain free\" and avoid being billed 0.01 per message, they must, according to the text, forward the message to 10 contacts (red flag #2: good advice doesn't usually require being shared to a specific number of people): We hope no one spent any time looking for little blue lights, because this message is complete nonsense. (Red flag #3: The paper? What year is this?) It was nearly identical to one example included in a rolling fact check that we originally published in December 2009 and have updated many times since as different variations of this hoax have emerged over time. In one iteration, David Mikkelson reported: Those who attempted to exempt themselves from the charge thereby spread the lie even further, thus doing the leg work of the hoaxsters. (The logical disconnect of the practical joke seemed to evade many: If Facebook were bent upon extracting fees from its users, why would it choose to exempt any of them?) We rate the newer variation as False, again, because, if Facebook — one of the most widely used sites in the history of the internet — had reversed course on its longstanding promise to remain a free site, it would have probably been mentioned somewhere on its website or on the internet at large. We found no such announcement. Furthermore, the above-displayed message resembles other messages that have been publicly debunked by Facebook representatives in the company’s Help community forum:",

    "claim": "Ted Livingston, the CEO of Kik Interactive, announced in September 2019 that the Kik messaging app would be shutting down. ",
    "rating": "True",
    "article_text": "Claim: Ted Livingston, the CEO of Kik Interactive, announced in September 2019 that the Kik messaging app would be shutting down. Rating: True About this rating On Sept. 24, 2019, a number of news outlets reported that the messaging app Kik would be shutting down. According to the BBC: Kik Messenger is shutting down despite the service having millions of active users around the world. The company said it was closing down the messaging service so it could concentrate on the Kin cryptocurrency it has also created. The news came as a shock to many Kik users, especially because, as of this writing, an official statement about the messenger app shutting down had not been posted to the company's website or official Twitter or Facebook pages. To confuse matters further, an unrelated hoax about Ted Livingston, the CEO of Kik Interactive, was circulated in the aftermath of these reports. Livingston announced that the Kik messenger app was closing in a Medium blog post published on Sept. 23 about the company's legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the cryptocurrency Kin. Livingston wrote that the company's legal fight with the SEC had drained resources and led to some hard decisions, such as closing down the messenger app. Livingston wrote (emphasis ours): After 18 months of working with the SEC the only choice they gave us was to either label Kin a security or fight them in court. Becoming a security would kill the usability of any cryptocurrency and set a dangerous precedent for the industry. So with the SEC working to characterize almost all cryptocurrencies as securities we made the decision to step forward and fight. While we are ready to take on the SEC in court, we underestimated the tactics they would employ. How they would take our quotes out of context to manipulate the public to view us as bad actors. How they would pressure exchanges not to list Kin. And how they would draw out a long and expensive process to drain our resources. Instead of selling some of our Kin into the limited liquidity that exists today, we made the decision to focus our current resources on the few things that matter most. So today we are announcing three things: We will shut down the Kik app We will reduce our headcount to an elite 19 person team We will focus on one thing: converting Kin users into Kin buyers These are hard decisions. Kik is one of the largest apps in the US. It has industry leading engagement and is growing again. Over 100 employees and their families will be impacted. People who have poured their hearts and souls into Kik and Kin for over a decade. Livingston provided few details about the shuttering of Kik. Some Kik users reported encountering a message on the chat app about Kik shutting down on Sept. 27, but a spokesperson for the company told us that this was not an official message from the Kik team: We can confirm that Kik will be shutting down but the timing and details of the user experience has not yet been shared - that will be released in the coming days. The post you attached (claiming that Kik would shut down on Sept. 27) is not true.",

    "article_text": "Claim: TikTok is banned in China. Rating: Unproven About this rating Context TikTok has never been available in China, as the country has its own version of the app, called Douyin. Both apps are owned by the same Chinese company, ByteDance. Thus far, we've been unable to find definitive proof that TikTok is or is not officially banned in China. In early March 2023, claims began to spread on social media platforms that TikTok is banned in China. A video was posted to Facebook on Feb. 17, 2023, that claimed the social media app had been banned from the country. \"Did you know that TikTok is also banned in China?\" the video said. \"Yes. See, here is a list of apps that are banned in China. So TikTok is even banned in China.\" The claim also spread on Twitter, where writer Hank Green and conservative commenter Steven Crowder both posted that the app had been banned in the country. Tiktok is banned in China, which makes this whole conversation almost otherworldly. — Hank Green (@hankgreen) March 22, 2023 TikTok is not available in the country, and hasn't been since it was first launched in 2016. That said, there is no official evidence proving or disproving that China banned TikTok. As such, we rate the claim Unproven. At the time of this publication, Chinese company ByteDance owned social media apps TikTok and Douyin. TikTok is available internationally, but you cannot find the app in the Chinese app store. Instead, you would find Douyin, which has been described as the country's domestic alternative to TikTok. It is held on a different server than TikTok, which researchers have attributed to ByteDance complying with internet regulations by the Chinese government. Douyin is available via the web . When we reviewed the website, we found that it was fully in Chinese and had an infrastructure similar to TikTok's, including the logo, as well as like and share icons. We found that we could fully view videos on the platform without an account. We could not verify whether the same videos are accessible on both platforms. The Facebook video purporting to show a list of apps banned in China is false. It was actually a list of top non-gaming apps downloaded in September 2020, worldwide. While some apps on the list were banned in China at the time of publication, other apps like Zoom were available in the country. The claims came around the same time that TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified before Congress for the first time on March 23. According to Insider , at least 27 U.S. states have banned the app from government devices, and there have been calls for a nationwide ban because of national security concerns. Other countries have already banned the app. India permanently banned TikTok in January 2021, while countries like Norway and Denmark have banned the app from work devices.",

    "article_text": "Claim: The Japanese government banned the development of 5G technology over health concerns. Rating: False About this rating On June 9, 2019, a website named Putin Tomorrow posted a story claiming that the Japanese government would be banning 5G cellular technology “for the health of [its] citizens.” The term \"5G\" — 5th-generation wireless networks — is a frequent boogeyman on health conspiracy websites that allege unsubstantiated negative health effects from the technology. The Putin Tomorrow article fits that mold, claiming that the “Ministry of High Technologies” posted an announcement on their official website that they would be banning the development of, and investment in, this cellular technology, while citing someone named Nobunari Kabato as that ministry’s head: “We need to think about the health of the Japanese. Our country has already accelerated economically so that today we have nowhere to hurry. It is necessary to stabilize this state. 5G is fraught with great danger. So we think not only we, yesterday this information was confirmed by the US ambassador to Japan. If America, China or the EU countries are ready to risk their people for the sake of progress, then such a strategy is unacceptable for our welfare state, ”said Nobunari Kabato, Minister of High Technologies. At least three reasons exist why the above assertion is baseless. First, \"Nobunari Kabato\" appears to be a made-up name: The only Google search result for it is the article we are presently debunking. Second, no “Ministry of High Technology” exists in the Japanese government. The closest entity to that would be the “Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology,” which is run by a man named Kōichi Hagiuda. Finally, and contrary to the headline claim in the article, Japan is actively investing in 5G technology. In fact, Japanese companies are actually investing in what the Nikeii Asian Review described as a ”14 [billion dollar] spending blitz for nationwide 5G.” In April, that outlet reported that “Japan's government ... approved plans by four mobile network operators to build superfast fifth-generation wireless networks, with investment set to total 1.6 trillion yen ($14.4 billion) over the next five years.” As such, we rate this claim as \"False.\"",

Rating: True About this rating Robots in wolves’ clothing turned out to be a useful investment for a small Japanese town in late 2020. Amidst growing accounts of bear encounters and sightings around the northern island town of Takikawa in September, city officials deployed the “Monster Wolf” robot to tackle the problem. The two robots were installed around farmland, and were meant to scare away intruders. The “Monster Wolf” is a shaggy body on four legs, with a blond mane and glowing-red eyes. When its motion detectors are activated, it moves its head, flashes lights, and emits 60 different sounds including howling and machine-like noises. The robots are manufactured by Ohta Seiki, which has sold around 70 units since 2018. https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=45&v=-gI3KdrKfbs&feature=emb_title According to Japanese news outlet Kyodo News , there were 13,670 bear sightings across the various islands in Japan from April to September 2020 — the highest number for this time period since 2016. There have also been dozens of bear attacks, with two of them resulting in fatalities. Takikawa city officials said bears were searching for food before their hibernation period in late November, and a decrease of their usual sources of nutrition in the wild may have driven them closer to towns in search of sustenance. Real wolves once roamed Japan’s forests more than a hundred years ago, but have been hunted into extinction. And the robot wolves appear to be doing the job since city officials say there were no reported bear encounters after the robots were installed.",

    "rating": "True",
    "article_text": "Claim: A picture authentically shows a young Jeff Bezos in Amazon company offices during its early days in 1999. Rating: True About this rating Nearly three decades ago, Amazon was founded as a website that aimed to sell books quickly and efficiently. Since then it expanded into a tech conglomerate worth billions of dollars, making it one of the world's largest online retailers. We spotted a picture claiming to represent the company and its founder, Jeff Bezos, in relatively more humble origins. The picture claims to show Bezos' offices in 1999, and depicts him seated before an older model computer, with \"amazon.com\" painted on a sign on the wall next to him. This is indeed an accurate picture of Amazon offices in its early days. We searched for pictures or videos of his office and found this 1999 report titled \"Nerd of the Amazon\" from CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" in which correspondent Bob Simon interviewed the tech mogul. While the report itself does not feature the exact shot above, we know that Simon is seated next to Bezos and the office in which he conducts part of the interview is the same with the \"amazon.com\" sign. Bezos' office can be seen at the 1:37 mark: (Screenshot via 60 Minutes/YouTube) Earlier in the interview Simon says of Bezos' desk, which happens to be an old door, \"Come on! You can afford a better desk than that.\" In response, Bezos says, \"It's a symbol of spending money on the things that matter to customers, and not spending money on the things that don't.\" \"And you don't need clean carpets,\" Simon retorts. At that point in 1999, Simon described Bezos as \"a giant\" and a \"titan of our time.\" Bezos was a billionaire who still worked out of dingy Seattle offices. Amazon was a relatively new phenomenon, but Simon was incredulous about the state of the office. \"More like a college dorm than a corporate headquarters,\" Simon said. His introduction to Bezos also poked fun at the billionaire's unusual laugh: \"You generally hear him before you see him [...] It's the ear-piercing laugh of billionaire Jeff Bezos.\" The same office, but with a different individual seated alongside Bezos, was featured in a \"60 Minutes Australia\" interview that aired in 2000, as per the program's official YouTube account. The moment featuring Bezos' office can be seen at the 6:29 mark: Liz Hayes, the correspondent, pointed out, \"Like everyone else in his office, Bezos uses an old door as a desk.\" The office shown in this interview has the same sign on the wall, and the same desk and computer as the photograph above, but the person sitting next to Bezos is different. (Screenshot of 60 Minutes Australia/YouTube) Given that we have footage from Bezos' two interviews in 1999 and 2000 with shots from the same office and featuring Bob Simon, the correspondent from the Reddit picture, we rate this claim a \"True.\"",

Jim Jordan's Twitter account after he was suspended from Twitter: Jordan has not been suspended from Twitter. While this screenshot is real, the @RepJimJordan Twitter account does not belong to the Ohio congressman. Jordan's official Twitter account resides under the handle @jim_jordan. This account is listed on the congressman's official website. And the account, which has over 2.2 million followers, is still active. Jordan regularly uses this account for politics. His two most recent posts, as of this writing, were \" Freedom !\" and \" Move the Super Bowl to Ohio! \" On more consequential matters, Jordan used this account to issue a statement that he would not be cooperating in the bipartisan investigation into the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Jordan previously said that he would cooperate as he had \" nothing to hide .\" It isn't clear who set up the @RepJimJordan account, or what it was being used for. There are no archived versions of this page available. While we can't tell you what @RepJimJordan was posting, the fact that there are no archives of this page suggests that this was a relatively new account that was not monitored by political reporters because it was never used by the congressman. In all likelihood, this account was suspended for impersonating a lawmaker. The false claim that Jordan's Twitter account was suspended from Twitter comes a few days after another politician, Georgia U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, was permanently suspended from Twitter for repeated violations of the network's COVID-19 misinformation policy. The social network also banned former President Donald Trump after a mob of his supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol in January 2021. Twitter stated that account was suspended \"due to the risk of further incitement of violence.\" Source: Broadwater, Luke. “Jim Jordan Refuses to Cooperate With Jan. 6 Panel.” The New York Times, 10 Jan. 2022.

    "article_text": "Claim: John McAfee had a \"$WHACKD\" tattoo and tweeted in 2019 that \"If I suicide myself, I didn't. I was whackd.\" Rating: Mostly True About this rating Context This tattoo and message are both real. They are not, however, evidence that McAfee was assassinated by the government. If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health, suicide or substance use crisis or emotional distress, reach out 24/7 to the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) by dialing or texting 988 or using chat services at suicidepreventionlifeline.org to connect to a trained crisis counselor. On June 24, 2021,John McAfee, an eccentric security software pioneer, was found dead in his prison cell hours after Spain approved his extradition to the United States to face tax evasion charges. While officials from the Catalan government said in a statement that \"everything points to death by suicide,\" social media users started sharing the hashtag #McAfeedidntkillhimself and pointed to a 2019 tweet in which Mcafee showed a \"$WHACKD\" tattoo as evidence. This is a genuine tweet from McAfee. The security software pioneer truly had the \"$WHACKD\" tattooed on his arm (you can see another image of the tattoo here ) and he truly did write \"If I suicide myself, I didn't. I was whackd\" in a tweet. However, this message from November 2019 was more than a year before McAfee was facing the very real possibility that he would spend the rest of his life in prison. While McAfee's November 2019 tweet may have summed up his mentality at the time, it does not necessarily provide any insight into his state of mind at the time of his death. It should also be noted that McAfee did not get this tattoo solely to signal that he was not suicidal. This tattoo also promoted a cryptocurrency token on the now defunct website McAfeedex.com. McAfee promoted this cryptocurrency token on his site by connecting it to another death, that of Jeffrey Epstein , which many have claimed (with little evidence) was an assassination disguised as a suicide. McAfee, 75, was arrested in Spain in October 2020 as he was about to board a plane to Turkey. McAfee was wanted in the United States for various tax evasion charges. The BBC reported : In October 2020, John McAfee was arrested in Spain when he was about to board a plane to Turkey, and accused of failing to file tax returns for four years, despite earning millions from consulting work, speaking engagements, crypto-currencies and selling the rights to his life story. The US justice department alleged that McAfee evaded tax liability by having his income paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts in the names of nominees. He was also accused of concealing assets, including a yacht and real estate property, also in other people's names. McAfee was being held in a jail near Barcelona while he awaited extradition. On June 24, 2021, a Spanish court approved his extradition to the United States where he would face charges. If convicted, McAfee could have been sentenced to as much as 30 years in prison. Hours after McAfee's extradition was approved, however, the software pioneer was found dead in his prison cell. The Justice Department for the government of Catalonia said that an autopsy would be conducted before officially determining a cause of death. At the moment, however, the Spanish government says that \"everything points to death by suicide.\" McAfee's lawyer, Javier Villalba, also told Reuters that McAfee died by suicide. British-born U.S. technology entrepreneur John McAfee died on Wednesday by suicide in a Barcelona prison after the Spanish high court authorized his extradition to the United States on tax evasion charges, his lawyer told Reuters. McAfee's lawyer, Javier Villalba, said the anti-virus software pioneer died by hanging as his nine months in prison brought him to despair.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A map from Johns Hopkins University that shows the spread of COVID-19 contains malware. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True Generally speaking, malicious actors have tried to spread malware via various online maps by disguising it as information from credible sources about the global spread of COVID-19. What's False However, the real-time map from Johns Hopkins University showing the spread of COVID-19 is itself safe and does not contain malware. In March 2020, as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus grew into a global pandemic, worried citizens of the world took to the internet in search of information about the disease caused by the virus, COVID-19. They turned to organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to get an accurate picture of how fast the disease was spreading, where cases were being reported, and what they should do to keep themselves (and their communities) safe. Johns Hopkins University also provided a valuable resource in the form of a real-time map that showed how the disease was spreading around the globe. At the time of this writing, the map from Hopkins' Coronavirus Research Center shows 137,445 total confirmed cases that have resulted in just over 5,000 deaths. This is a genuine map from Johns Hopkins that is safe to access here . Unfortunately, malicious actors saw the heightened concerns about COVID-19 as an opportunity to start spreading misinformation and malware. On March 9, 2020, Reason Security released a report stating that maps similar to the one above were being used to trick people into downloading malware: As global awareness of a Coronavirus pandemic gradually gives way to full out panic, and as governments begin ramping up their efforts to combat the virus and protect its citizens, global news agencies find themselves racing to answer the public’s demand for accurate information about new Corona related infections, deaths, transmissions, etc. This demand creates a vulnerability that malicious actors have quickly taken advantage of by spreading malware disguised as a “Coronavirus map”. Reason Labs’ cybersecurity researcher, Shai Alfasi, found and analyzed this malware that had weaponized coronavirus map applications in order to steal credentials such as user names, passwords, credit card numbers and other sensitive information that is stored in the users’ browser. Attackers can use this information for many other operations as well, such as selling it on the deep web or for gaining access to bank accounts or social media. Hacker News explained that this malware attack targets people who are searching for any maps about COVID-19 and tricks them into downloading a map with a file that runs a malicious application on the user's computer. Once downloaded, the map appears similar to the legitimate map from Johns Hopkins shown above, but the software will actually compromise the computer and attempt to steal personal information, such as passwords and credit card information. The malware attack specifically aims to target those who are looking for cartographic presentations of the spread of COVID-19 on the Internet, and tricks them to download and run a malicious application that, on its front-end, shows a map loaded from a legit online source but in the background compromises the computer. The real map from Johns Hopkins is viewable online and does not require you to download any software to use it. You can access the real-time tracking map by visiting this website . This is the official URL from Johns Hopkins, and no indication exists that this site is unsafe or infected with malware. ESRI, the company that provided the geographic information system (GIS) software to create Johns Hopkins' real-time coronavirus tracking map, attempted to clear up some of the confusion in a blog post. The company explained that the real online map found on Johns Hopkins' site \"does NOT contain any malware (and NEVER contained malware).\" The reports from Hacker News and the like are referring to a scam that uses an impostor version of the Hopkins map to trick users into downloading malware. ESRI writes (emphasis ours): An increasing number of articles have been published on the Internet with unclear and sometimes misleading information concerning one of the primary dashboards for awareness concerning the spread of the Coronavirus. To be clear, the online map posted by Johns Hopkins University at https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html does NOT contain any malware (and NEVER contained malware). This popular dashboard web application is hosted by Esri as part of our ArcGIS Online offering. The confusion comes from an issue where a malicious person created a downloadable Windows-based application containing malware whose display is practically identical to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus browser-based dashboard (see comparison figure below). Whomever posted the malicious downloadable app is attempting to take advantage of the hype around the Coronavirus, but it requires the user to either download the app executable, or it could be distributed by email for the user to then install onto their local Windows system. The malicious app once downloaded and installed deploys malware called AZORult which is designed to steal credentials in the background (among other activities). To make the user think they are getting a Coronavirus map viewer, the app calls the URL of the Johns Hopkins dashboard and displays the results inside the application window. Bottom-line, you are fine browsing the Coronavirus dashboard on the web with your browser as no software needs to be downloaded. If you come across someone offering a Coronavirus dashboard where you need to download software to view it, don’t use it! In summary, a real-time map that tracks the spread of COVID-19 around the globe is available to view on the Johns Hopkins University website . This map is safe to use and does not require you to download any software. If you encounter an email or social media post that asks you to download a similar map, be cautious. It's likely someone is attempting to trick you into downloading a piece of malware.",

    "article_text": "Claim: People should avoid plugging their phones into a public USB port due to a security threat called \"juice-jacking.\" Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True \"Juice-jacking\" is a real security threat. The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office issued an advisory to travelers in November 2019 warning them of the potential dangers of using public USB ports. What's False While it is technically possible for crooks to steal information or install malware via public USB ports, this practice doesn't appear to be widespread. On Nov. 8, 2019, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office published an advisory that warned travelers about \"juice-jacking,\" the practice of stealing information from or installing malware on phones while they are plugged into publicly accessible USB ports: Travelers should avoid using public USB power charging stations in airports, hotels and other locations because they may contain dangerous malware. In the USB Charger Scam, often called \"juice jacking,\" criminals load malware onto charging stations or cables they leave plugged in at the stations so they may infect the phones and other electronic devices of unsuspecting users. The malware may lock the device or export data and passwords directly to the scammer. TIPS: Use an AC power outlet, not a USB charging station. Take AC and car chargers for your devices when traveling. Consider buying a portable charger for emergencies. Juice-jacking is a real security threat, and travelers should certainly take note of these tips from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. However, this security threat was not new in November 2019, and safety features have been added to iOS and Android operating systems in order to combat this sort of crime. Furthermore, little evidence exists that juice jacking is a widespread problem. A USB cable has the capability of supplying power to a device, but it can also be used to transfer data. While this might be obvious when you are connecting your phone to another device (such as a laptop), data might not be the first thing you think of when plugging your phone into a USB-wall outlet. But security experts (and potentially criminals) have developed ways to turn these power outlets into data-transfer ports. Zdnet reported : USB connections were designed to work as both data and power transfer mediums, with no strict barrier between the two. As smartphones became more popular in the past decade, security researchers figured out they could abuse USB connections that a user might think was only transferring electrical power to hide and deliver secret data payloads. This type of attack received its own name, as \"juice jacking.\" While it is technically possible to turn a public USB-wall port into a malicious, data-transferring outlet, the criminal practice of juice-jacking doesn't appear to be widespread. In fact, when Tech Crunch followed up with the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office to ask about reports from people whose data had been stolen this way, the office reported it had \"no cases\" of juice-jacking on its books: Reading the advisory, you might be forgiven for thinking that every USB outlet you see is just waiting for you to plug in your phone so it can steal your data. This so-called \"juice-jacking\" attack involves criminals loading malware \"on charging stations or cables they leave plugged in at the stations so they may infect the phones and other electronic devices of unsuspecting users,\" it reads. \"The malware may lock the device or export data and passwords directly to the scammer.\" But the county's chief prosecutor's office told TechCrunch that it has \"no cases\" of juice-jacking on its books, though it said there are known cases on the east coast. When asked where those cases were, the spokesperson did not know. And when asked what prompted the alert to begin with, the spokesperson said it was part of \"an ongoing fraud education campaign.\" It should also be noted that both Android and iOS have incorporated features to prevent juice-jacking since this security threat first came to light circa 2011. On most modern phones, users will now see a pop-up alert if they are using a USB port that is capable of transferring data, instead of just power. To sum up: Juice-jacking is a genuine security threat, and the LA County District Attorney's Office did issue an advisory in November 2019 warning travelers against using public USB ports. However, while it's technically possible to juice-jack a phone, this is not a widespread criminal activity.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Kodak invented the world's first portable, digital camera in the 1970s, but didn't release the technology for public sale until years later to avoid hits to the company's photographic-film business. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True Kodak engineer Steve Sasson invented the first portable, digital camera in 1975. Kodak received a patent for the device in 1978, but did not put it into production. What's False While Kodak did not push forward with production in 1975 and challenged the wisdom of moving away from its camera-film market, the company's reasoning for not developing the digital camera was largely due to the device not being ready or practical for the market. In December 2024, a popular series of posts on X asserted that \"a Kodak engineer invented the world's first digital camera,\" but was told by higher-ups to abandon the project, providing a \"painful lesson in business history\": The post belongs to a long-standing genre of internet claims , holding that the film and camera company Eastman Kodak kept the digital invention hidden from the public because of the threat it posed to its photographic-film-based business model: Aspects of this argument are true. Though larger-scale applications involving the digitization of images already existed, Kodak engineer Steve Sasson created the first portable digital camera in 1975. He demonstrated the product to the company's executives, and they decided to patent the technology but not to develop it for sale. It is an oversimplification to say that fear over a future film-less world led Kodak to \"hide\" the invention from the public, in part because it neglects the fact that the product was not ready at the time, that no real market for the product existed in 1975, and that Kodak further developed digital cameras following this initial invention. Kodak received substantial sums from the patent it received for Sasson's device in 1978, as well. In 1973, at age 23, Sasson took a job as an electrical engineer at Kodak. As described by The New York Times in 2015, \"soon after arriving at Kodak, Mr. Sasson was given a seemingly unimportant task — to see whether there was any practical use for a charged coupled device (CCD), which had been invented a few years earlier.\" Such devices can translate light to digital signals, and are key to all digital cameras. Two years later, he had finished his device — a Frankensteined mishmash of leftover lenses, circuits, and a cassette tape for memory. As described by the Times: The final result was a Rube Goldberg device with a lens scavenged from a used Super-8 movie camera; a portable digital cassette recorder; 16 nickel cadmium batteries; an analog/digital converter; and several dozen circuits — all wired together on half a dozen circuit boards. By 1976, Sasson was ready to demo the invention to executives at Kodak, as he described to the photography outlet PetaPixel: \"I would walk in with my crazy-looking camera, which was about the size of a toaster, but I could hold it,\" Sasson says. \"I took pictures of people in the room before I said anything. Then I took out the tape that the digital information was stored on and put it in the playback unit when a picture popped up on the TV screen. And that generally got everybody's attention.\" \"Indeed, they didn't ask me how this worked,\" Sasson says. They simply asked me why anybody would want to take a picture this way when there was nothing wrong with conventional photography. Nobody [including the bosses at Kodak] was asking me to develop this camera. In fact, nobody even knew that I was developing this camera. The file size of the picture it produced — a black, white, and gray grid of 100 by 100 pixels — was 5 kilobytes. It took nearly a half a minute to save the data from the image to a cassette tape. \"It only took 50 milliseconds to capture the image, but it took 23 seconds to record it to the tape,\" Sasson said . When asked how long before this technology could match that of a film camera, Sasson figured it was about 15-20 years away. At the time, the photographs had to be displayed on a TV. Personal computers were far from ubiquitous — the first Apple I computer kit was released a year later in 1976. Business and marketing directors at Kodak were, indeed, skeptical of the wisdom of creating a product that could potentially make their photographic-film business obsolete. As reported in the Times, \"Kodak's marketing department was not interested in [Sasson's prototypes]. Mr. Sasson was told they could sell the camera, but wouldn't — because it would eat away at the company's film sales.\" While this may have been a motivating factor to some at Kodak, such concerns did not stop Kodak — or even Sasson — from further developing digital cameras and making several technical developments that led to Kodak's first publicly available digital camera in 1991, the Digital Camera System. As reported in a 1991 Associated Press article: Eastman Kodak Co is taking its first step into filmless photography with an electronic camera system that can turn a conventional Nikon into a high-tech electronic camera. The Professional Digital Camera System will sell for about $20000. It is intended primarily for photojournalists and government surveillance, Kodak said. Sasson's developments were crucial to develop this technology. In 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama awarded Sasson the National Medal of Technology and Innovation for his contributions to digital photography. Because the first portable digital camera was, indeed, invented in 1975 by Kodak, but because concerns about destroying its film business did not stop Kodak from developing the technology further, we rate this claim as a mixture of truth and falsehood.",

    "article_text": "Claim: The Las Vegas sphere displayed a Microsoft \"error\" message following a worldwide IT glitch in July 2024. Rating: Fake About this rating On July 19, 2024, Crowdstrike, a cyber security company utilized by Microsoft, launched a global software update that had massive repercussions. An Information Technology(IT) outage caused businesses, airlines and medical buildings around the world to have glitches in their Microsoft computing systems, according to NBC News . According to The Associated Press , these outages caused delays to air travel and business operation, \"highlighting the fragility of a digitized world dependent on just a handful of providers.\" The \"Blue Screen of Death\"(BSOD), a term coined for the Microsoft \"error\" message on computing systems, was displayed on Microsoft computing systems internationally. Examples of this happening can be seen in this special report from NBC: Another more peculiar example of a BSOD was posited to have been displayed on the Las Vegas Sphere. X users posted a photo of the attraction with a Microsoft \"error\" message on its screen. This photo, although it may have appeared authentic to some, was digitally altered and fake. We did fact checks on this same image in 2023 and 2024 . In both cases, we found that the image was fake. Utilizing the software FotoForensics , a platform that specializes in digital image forensics, we were able to test the authenticity of the image and detect any potential alterations or manipulations. With the software, we performed an Error Level Analysis (ELA) technique, intentionally resaving the image at a known error rate (such as 95%), then subtracting the resaved image from the original image to reveal the differences. These differences, or \"error levels,\" can help identify areas of the image that were added or modified. If an image is unaltered, the entire image should have a similar error level. However, if parts of the image were added or altered, those areas will likely have a different error level, indicating potential manipulation. The result was as follows: (FotoForensics) When the original elements of the image are stripped away, the text and overlay of the Sphere after the fact becomes clear, meaning this image was manipulated. In addition to that manipulation, no reputable news sources have spread any news of the Sphere showing a BSOD as a result of the global IT outage. For these reasons, we label the claim, \"Fake.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: The last pay phone in New York City was removed on May 23, 2022. Rating: False About this rating Fact Check On May 23, 2022, various news headlines, tweets, and online videos proclaimed that the \"last\" or \"final\" pay phone had been removed from New York City . The way that some headlines were worded likely gave the impression that there were no more pay phones at all left in the city. However, this was not true. For example, one false headline from a major publisher appeared at the top of Google search results with the headline, \"New York City removes the last payphone from service.\" Such news stories told of how the city's LinkNYC service was growing. It seeks to \"replace outdated payphones to improve New Yorkers' access to the internet\" by providing \"free public Wi-Fi service.\" On Twitter, the account for the NYC Office of Technology and Innovation posted a misleading tweet that read, \"Proud to bid farewell to NYC's final pay phone!\" Another example of how viral this false rumor was came from the verified @timessquare.nyc TikTok account. One of the account's managers posted a video of the purported final pay phones being removed from the city with the caption, \"The last payphone in NYC was removed today from Times Square.\" The video received more than 2 million likes and was viewed well over 10 million times in just over 24 hours. In the hours after the news broke, skeptics began to flood social media platforms with comments saying that the removed Times Square pay phones were not even close to being the last ones remaining in New York City. On TikTok, one user commented, \"This is not true. There are so many still in NYC.\" Another person responded, \"There's a payphone on the Upper West Side.\" Several other people said they still had pay phones in their own neighborhoods, presumably somewhere in the five boroughs (the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island). NPR.com wrote of the viral news, \"Fear not, nostalgia-seekers and 'The Matrix' fans: There are still a handful of pay phones scattered around New York City.\" The article clarified that the pay phones removed from Times Square were supposedly the last public pay phones in the city, and that there were still private pay phones owned by businesses that were located throughout New York. Also mentioned in the NPR story was the fact that there were four walk-in booths that were still active on the Upper West Side of New York City. Such booths have been referred to as \"Superman\" pay phone booths. (The history of the DC comic book character's very rare usage of phone booths might run counter to some readers' memories.) On top of these four walk-in booths and the private pay phone booths that were still available throughout the city, NPR pointed to reporting from HellgateNYC.com with the headline, \"The Death of NYC Pay Phones Has Been Greatly Exaggerated.\" The story said that a working public pay phone was found inside the 14th St-Union Square subway station, just a few stops from where the \"final\" pay phones were removed on May 23. In fact, the blog even said it recorded a call made from the public pay phone. Much of the effort to document the history of pay phones, including in New York City, can be credited to The Payphone Project , a website that's been operated by Mark Thomas since 1995. In response to the false news that New York City's final pay phone had been removed, The Payphone Project tweeted , \"To hell with facts!\" In another tweet , the account replied to the news with, \"Not even close to CityBridge's last public payphone on NYC streets but why let facts get in the way of a superficially superficial story? Kind of a bizarre and meaningless photo op, tbh.\" Also found on The Payphone Project's Twitter account was a link to the website, payphoneradio.com , which is a \"radio stream\" that \"contains recordings of phone calls made almost entirely from New York City payphones.\" In sum, no, the last pay phones in New York City weren't removed. Evidence suggested that there were still pay phones available throughout the city, both public and private. For these reasons, we rated the claim that the last pay phone had been removed from New York City on May 23, 2022, as \"False.\"",

Rating: Fake About this rating In early May 2024, a photograph allegedly captured in 1930 and purportedly showing \"Hoggie,\" a legendary loch monster in Scotland, went viral on social media. \"The famous photo taken on this day in 1930 of 'Hoggie,' the legendary Hogganfield Loch monster which was finally captured after many years of folk doubting its existence,\" a post shared on Threads read. \"Lochness Monster,\" one 9GAG post captioned the photograph. (Threads user @historicillustrations) The photograph also spread on Facebook , TikTok , Imgur , and iFunny . However, the image was generated using AI software, so we have rated it as Fake. TinEye reverse-image search results indicated that users didn't begin sharing the image in October 2023. Moreover, the viral photo had numerous tell-tale signs of being AI-generated. For instance, when we zoomed in the photograph, we noticed the people's faces were blurred and deformed. (Threads user @historicillustrations) The more we zoomed in the photograph, the more evident it was that it was created using AI-powered software. (Threads user @historicillustrations)) A tool designed to help detect AI-generated imagery, Is It AI? , indicated the image was highly likely to have been created using artificial intelligence. Hive , another AI detector, concluded with 100% certainty that the image was AI. (Hive AI Detector) Beyond the fact that the image was fabricated, we weren't able to find any evidence that \"Hoggie, the Loch Hogganfield monster,\" even exists as a myth in Scotland (like \"Nessie,\" the infamous \"Loch Ness monster\"). We have fact-checked many other viral AI-generated images. In April 2024 we debunked a vintage, black-and-white photo allegedly showing members of the Rothschild family standing next to a \"demon.\" We have also investigated whether a picture that went viral online in May 2024 authentically showed an abandoned McDonald's restaurant in Pripyat, Ukraine, near the site of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster.

    "claim": "The ride-sharing app Lyft has a safety feature that &quot;checks in&quot; with users if their car deviates from their route. ",
    "rating": "True",
    "article_text": "Claim: The ride-sharing app Lyft has a safety feature that \"checks in\" with users if their car deviates from their route. Rating: True About this rating In June 2021, social media users enthusiastically shared a post that appeared to show a safety feature of the ride-sharing application Lyft, whereby users in vehicles that deviate from the expected route receive a notification from the app, which allows them to contact emergency services in the event they are in danger. On June 4, the Shannon's Tea Cup Party Facebook page posted what appeared to be a screenshot from the Lyft app, containing the following text: Just checking in It looks like you're not heading to your destination. Do you need help? Report safety issue or accident Get emergency help No Thanks A user of the internet forum Reddit published a similar post in April 2021, which contained a similar screenshot and the explanation: \"Lyft sees your driver taking a different route and it checks in on you.\" Those posts referred to a real safety feature on Lyft, and we are therefore issuing a rating of \"True.\" In response to our questions, a spokesperson for the company told Snopes that the screenshot contained in the Shannon's Tea Cup Party Facebook post showed the \"Smart Trip Check-in\" safety feature in action: In some instances, if we notice a ride that appears to be irregular, we can reach out to riders and drivers directly. This may include rides that have ended far from the intended destination, been cancelled after pickup, gone off-route or stopped for an abnormal amount of time. We’ll ask users if they need help, and if appropriate, connect them to emergency assistance or our own Safety team. Depending on each Lyft user's notification settings, the check-in feature will result in either a push notification sent through the app itself, or a text message to the user's phone. Although many social media users discovered the feature for the first time in the spring and summer of 2021, Lyft's spokesperson told Snopes it was first launched in early 2020.",

    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: \"1 in 2 two Mac users\" are unaware of a \"trick\" that would allow them to clean their computer. Rating: False About this rating Context An ad that said \"1 in 2 Mac users\" were \"unaware\" of a \"trick\" simply led to a software utility download with options for monthly or annual pricing. Since at least 2017, online advertisements have promised a special \"trick\" to help people with Mac computers. For example, one of the ads claimed: \"1 in 2 Mac Users Are Unaware of This Trick to Clean Their Mac.\" Some of the ads appeared with this picture and text. The ad seemed to hint at a special, built-in, too-little-known function that Apple ships with its macOS updates. Perhaps it had something to do with an application in the Utilities folder, such as Disk Utility. Or maybe it was about something involving the Console or Terminal apps. The Utilities folder on a Mac can actually be quite useful. The 'Trick' However, the ad did not lead to a special \"trick.\" Instead, readers who clicked the ad were presented with a piece of software called MacKeeper. One of its primary functions appeared to be that it would clean up the file system on a Mac. It was priced with a choice of monthly or annual charges. We were unable to find any data on the MacKeeper website regarding whether or not \"1 in 2 Mac users\" were \"unaware\" of a \"trick\" to clean their Mac. However, we did find one page that claimed: \"1 in 2 of our users have had a virus before using MacKeeper.\" Mac Users Discuss the Ads In 2017, a person using the name DJDS-70 asked a question about the ads on Apple's official community discussion forums. They received an answer from a user named Yer_Man: DJDS-70: I saw this recent ad on the Newstream: 1 In 2 Mac Users Unaware Of This Computer Trick Mac owners urged to do this today...see why. It was posted by ScanGuard. Has anyone used it? Are they connected to Apple? Yer_Man: How on earth would they know what half of Mac users know or don't. Or half of Windows users? Or half of Yorkshire terrier owners. It's such a flatulent piece of copy that really, your common sense should tell you it's rubbish. A Familiar Advertising Strategy The ad about the purported Mac \"trick\" might remind some readers of other ads about which we've reported. For example, a 2021 ad for the Capital One Shopping coupon code browser extension claimed that Amazon Prime membership prices had gone up. In reality, Amazon Prime pricing hadn't increased in nearly three years. In sum, we found no evidence that \"1 in 2 Mac users\" were unaware of anything having to do with a \"trick\" to clean their computers.",

    "claim": "A video on social media authentically depicts bottles of Maker’s Mark bourbon being hand-dipped in signature red wax by a distillery employee.",
    "rating": "True",
    "article_text": "Claim: A video on social media authentically depicts bottles of Maker’s Mark bourbon being hand-dipped in signature red wax by a distillery employee. Rating: True About this rating In late January 2025, a short video circulated on social media accompanied by a claim that Maker's Mark employees dip bottles of the Kentucky-made bourbon in a distinctive red wax by hand rather than use an automated machine. The claim was shared widely on X ( archived ), where users questioned both whether it was true and what the purpose of the red wax was. One user asked ( archived ): \"Any idea why these bottles are dipped ? i don't drink, so no idea.\" Every Maker's Mark bottle is dipped into melted red wax by a distillery employee, not a machine ?bourbonfinds pic.twitter.com/sQoilTUfEu — Science girl (@gunsnrosesgirl3) January 22, 2025 The answer to the latter question is simple — the manufacturer's decision to seal every bottle with red wax is a marketing tactic. Maker's Mark even trademarked its red wax seal in 1985. In 2010, the company filed a lawsuit against tequila company Jose Cuervo and alcohol distributor Diageo for infringing on that copyright by manufacturing and distributing products with red wax seal. According to legal documents , Maker's Mark were not awarded any damages in the lawsuit, but the defendants ultimately shelled out nearly $67,000 to Maker's Mark for legal costs. Additionally, the court issued an injunction, preventing the use of \"red dripping wax on the cap of a bottle in the sale, offering for sale, distribution or advertising of Cuervo tequila products at any locality within the United States.\" As far as the hand-dipping rumor, workers at the Maker's Mark Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, do indeed dip each bottle of bourbon into red wax by hand, according to the public relations and marketing agency that represents Maker's Mark, Doe-Anderson . No evidence refuted that assertion. Furthermore, Doe-Anderson confirmed the video circulating on social media supposedly showing the process was authentic. The firm said the video was recorded at the distillery. It shows no signs of digital manipulation or artificial intelligence (AI). Doe-Anderson provided additional video footage and photos that show the dipping process. Two of those pictures are below. (Maker's Mark) Footage depicting the dipping process is available for viewing on the Doe-Anderson Vimeo page . The red wax was created by Margie Mattingly Samuels , who came from a Kentucky-based, bourbon-making family and cofounded Maker's Mark with her husband Bill Samuels in 1953. A press release by the Kentucky Bourbon Hall of Fame , which inducted Margie Samuels in 2014, stated: A noted collector of fine English pewter, Mrs. Samuels knew the \"maker's mark\" was a symbol of handcrafted quality. She created the unique red wax that drips down the neck of the bottle she designed, as well as the label and lettering that's now an internationally recognized type style. The release also includes this quote from Samuels' son Bill Samuels Jr.: As Associate Editor of my high school yearbook, I'll never forget that day when I came home from school and all my things were sitting outside because Mom had thrown out my photo lab to set up a wax test kitchen in the basement. I was so aggravated with her in that moment, but looking back 60 years, I know that what she accomplished compared to what I might have is just monumental. According to a feature story about the red wax on the food website Chowhound , the first bottle of Maker's Mark with the now-standard look hit shelves in 1958. The article reiterated the company's claim about dipping the bottles by hand instead of using machinery: \"Because Maker's Mark uses this hand-dipping wax process, the company can't produce as many bottles per hour — making only around 100 to 200 instead of 200 to 400 — and it adds production costs, but it's hard to imagine the brand without this distinctive topper.\"",

However, the man shown using the jetpack, known as a \"Jet Suit,\" was an operator for Gravity Industries, not an active British Royal Marine. Fact Check On June 27, 2022, comedian Josh Wolf posted a video to Facebook that showed a Reddit post with the caption, \"Marines perform boarding exercises with jetpacks and landing on a high-speed ship.\" Within four days, it had been viewed more than 7 million times. Readers emailed us to ask if the clip was real. We're happy to report that the video was genuine and had not been doctored. From Facebook to Reddit to YouTube In the Facebook clip, a man using a jetpack boards a moving vessel with special equipment attached to both of his arms. The video showed a screen recording of a Reddit post from Jan. 6, 2022. Months later, the post had received a total score of more than 117,000 points. For any readers who aren't familiar with Reddit , this score was enormous and made it one of the most upvoted posts for the month of January. (Upvotes are similar to Facebook \"likes.\") The original video was posted to YouTube by Gravity Industries on May 1, 2021. Gravity Industries created the jetpack, which it referred to as a \"Jet Suit.\" \"Thanks to Royal Marines LLC for setting up a very successful exercise testing the capability of the Gravity Jet Suit to support RM boarding ops,\" the video's description read. Marines Weren't Flying the Jetpacks We found additional reporting from Business Insider, which published that the men shown flying the jetpacks in the longer YouTube video were Gravity Industries operators, not active British Royal Marines. The story also mentioned that Trial sponsor Lt. Col. Will Clarke RM said of the Jet Suit, \"It shows significant promise and we will watch its development with continued interest.\" The Gravity Industries YouTube channel showed many more videos of its products being tested across the world. The clip may have reminded some readers of jetpacks used in movies, such as the characters Jango and Boba Fett in the \"Star Wars\" films. Jetpacks also appeared in \"Minority Report,\" \"The Rocketeer,\" and \"Jingle All the Way,\" among others. In sum, yes, the \"Marines perform boarding exercises with jetpacks\" video was real. However, the clip showed Gravity Industries operators flying the special Jet Suits, not active Marines or other military members.",

The photograph was posted on Zuckerberg's verified Instagram account in early October 2023 and revealed the injuries were a result of mixed martial arts (MMA) training. The real caption stated: \"Sparring got a little out of hand. May need to update my avatar.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mark Zuckerberg (@zuck) Zuckerberg has been a practitioner of Brazilian jiu-jitsu and even competed successfully in some featherweight white belt categories in a California tournament. The two tech giants have been at odds with each other over several years. In June 2023, they even seemed to agree to face each other in a cage fight. By August 2023, Zuckerberg said Musk \"isn't serious\" about the match, and that \"it's time to move on.\" The above tweet appears to be posted in response to their on-again-off-again rivalry and their past desire to face off against each other in an actual fight. Given that it is a real photograph from Zuckerberg's Instagram account showing him after a sparring session and not a result of Musk making good on his challenge to face Zuckerberg in a fight, we rate this claim as \"Miscaptioned.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: Posting a statement on Instagram or Facebook will stop Meta from using users' data to train generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Rating: False About this rating In late May and early June 2024, a disclaimer was spread on social media, allegedly preventing Meta from using users' content for training its Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. This copypasta , a copied-and-pasted text often used to pass along an alleged warning of some sort, went viral in the light of European Facebook and Instagram users receiving a notification about a privacy policy update that would give Meta permission to use their posts to train its AIs. \"I own the copyright to all images and posts submitted to my instagram profile and therefore do not consent to Meta or other companies using them to train generative AI platforms. This includes future AND past posts/stories/threads on my profile,\" the copy-pasted text read. (Facebook user SarahSantos.art) One Instagram post of the copypasta text read: Meta is stealing from artists without our consent and feeding our work to their AI. ? We rely on these platforms to share our art with the world, to make connections and find work in an industry that's already unstable. I'm not sure what our alternative is, but I'm ready for a place that respects artists enough not to steal our art without consent. Seems like @cara_artists is our next best bet. I own the copyright to all images and posts submitted to my Instagram profile and therefore DO NOT consent to Meta or other companies using them to train generative Al platforms. This includes all FUTURE and PAST posts/stories on my profile. #noaiart #illustration #artistsoninstagram \"No further posts from me until meta decides to stop using all our posts to train their ai. If you are unaware please look into the situation. So long for now!,\" another Instagram user wrote . The copypasta was even shared by a renowned tennis player, Rafael Nadal. \"More than 250 thousand users shared a message on their IG stories refusing to use their posts to train Meta's AI,\" the fact-checking organization Maldita reported . To be clear, simply posting a disclaimer does not override a company's terms of service or negate its privacy policies. Because posting such a disclaimer on Instagram or Facebook would not stop Meta from using users' data to train generative AI models, we have rated this claim as \"False.\" \"How is it that people my age who have lived through several iterations of the fake 'I hereby declare Facebook cannot use my pictures' copypasta thing are posting one on instagram regarding AI training now? Guys cmon,\" one X post on the topic read . Jeremy Fisher, a stop-motion director and animator, told NBC News that \"many of the fellow artists he follows on Instagram have reshared the viral copypasta statement because of AI-related copyright concerns\": \"They're not super involved in the AI conversation for the most part,\" Fisher said. \"It seems like they're trying to check boxes and make sure that this is a thing that protects their work. ... It seems very much just like 'OK, I posted that, and I should be fine and good to go.'\" Facebook's terms of service state that \"if you share a photo on Facebook, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as Meta Products or service providers that support those products and services.\" What's more, a September 2023 article with the title \"Privacy Matters: Meta's Generative AI read : Generative AI models take a large amount of data to effectively train, so a combination of sources are used for training, including information that's publicly available online, licensed data and information from Meta's products and services. For publicly available online information, we filtered the dataset to exclude certain websites that commonly share personal information. \"Publicly shared posts from Instagram and Facebook – including photos and text – were part of the data used to train the generative AI models underlying the features we announced at Connect. We didn't train these models using people's private posts,\" the company stated, underscoring it wasn't using content of users' private messages to train AI models. \"Meta doesn't have an 'opt-out feature' for users who don't want the company to use their content for its AI training,\" Meta's spokesperson confirmed to WCNC VERIFY. In June 2024, Meta announced that until June 26, 2024, European users of Facebook and Instagram would have the option to opt out of having their posts used for training Meta's AI models. This opt-out feature was part of Meta's compliance with stricter data protection regulations in the European Union. However, this opt-out option was not available to users in the United States. On June 14, 2024, the Data Protection Commission reported that Meta had paused \"its plans to train its large language model using public content shared by adults on Facebook and Instagram\" across the European Union and European Economic Area: Meta's updated statement on the topic read : We're disappointed by the request from the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), our lead regulator, on behalf of the European DPAs, to delay training our large language models (LLMs) using public content shared by adults on Facebook and Instagram — particularly since we incorporated regulatory feedback and the European DPAs have been informed since March. \"This is a step backwards for European innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Europe,\" it continued, \"We remain highly confident that our approach complies with European laws and regulations. AI training is not unique to our services, and we're more transparent than many of our industry counterparts.\" To learn more on the topic, we recommend reading this article from our archives . It's also not the first time we have investigated a viral copypasta . For instance, we debunked the viral claim that posting a legal notice on your Facebook wall would protect you from having all your posts and photos \"made public\" by Facebook. Moreover, in May 2024, we looked at viral posts retelling a an alleged story about the encounters between former U.S. President Herbert Hoover and Polish pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Harvard students have created a tool to be used with Meta's smart glasses that can dox people in real time. Rating: Mostly True About this rating What's True I-XRAY, a tool built for Meta's smart glasses, can gather sensitive information about people from an image captured by the glasses. The tool uses publicly available online databases that can be used on any photo. What's False The software is not being made available to owners of Meta's smart glasses, software developers or any similar products. The tool is not being maintained and was last fully functional in November 2024, according to developers. In October 2024, two Harvard University students released ( archived ) details of a new tool they had built that could \"dox\" — identify personal information about — strangers by using Meta's smart glasses. Snopes readers asked us to look into this tool and whether it really could find personal information just from a picture captured by the glasses. In a video demonstrating the I-XRAY tool, developers AnhPhu Nguyen and Caine Ardayfio found the full names, addresses, former schools and names of relatives of people they said they had never met while wearing the smart glasses. \"Are we ready for a world where our data is exposed at a glance?\" Nguyen asked in the caption of the video. Though the tool was released in late September 2024 and picked up on in early reporting that October, claims about its use and capability persisted ( archived ) on social media ( archived ) into January 2025. In a Google doc published in September 2024, Nguyen and Ardayfio explained how the I-XRAY tool worked but did not reveal the specific details of how they built it. The document included links to a video showing the tool being used on what the developers said were strangers in real-life settings. On a video call on Jan. 20, 2025, Nguyen shared unedited videos showing the tool working in real time to identify both himself and Ardayfio. According to Nguyen, however, the tool was not being actively maintained and was last fully functional in November 2024. Therefore, we rate this claim as mostly true. Nguyen and Ardayfio purposefully did not publish the code behind the project, \"for reasons of public security and privacy,\" according to their release document . Nguyen told ( archived ) a user asking for the code of the project on X that it was \" too dangerous to just publish code. This is mainly for demonstration purposes & awareness.\" This conclusion was also reached by Silicon Valley developers. The New York Times reported in 2023 that Facebook, now Meta, developed similar software in 2017, capable of recognizing a person using a smartphone camera, but withheld it. Google withheld similar software in 2011, according to the report. The main danger posed by the software is that the people it is used on lose control of their personal information, and that the tool might be used for doxing or other malicious behavior, as noted in early reporting . The U.S. Department of Homeland Security defines doxing as: \"gathering an individual's personally identifiable information (PII) and releasing it publicly for malicious purposes such as public humiliation, stalking, identity theft, or targeting for harassment.\" Alongside the description of I-XRAY, Nguyen and Ardayfio included guidelines for members of the public to delete themselves from the databases used by the tool, rendering it ineffective. These included PimEyes , a website that can find, for example, other pictures of a person and connected information like a name when shown one image, and FastPeopleSearch , a search engine that can find personal information about people using for example their name. PimEyes said via email on Jan. 14 that its team had not been involved in the development of the I-XRAY tool and \"does not support such experiments.\" According to CEO Giorgi Gobronidze, Nguyen and Ardayfio likely found matches using personal PimEyes profiles, as the company had not provided API access — access to the site's code. Gobronidze further called Nguyen and Ardayfio's use of PimEyes a \"misuse\" of the site's technology, according to its terms of service, which says users must use PimEyes only for \" private, personal, and legitimate consumer purposes.\" Eight accounts \"potentially linked to the project authors\" on PimEyes had been closed, Gobronidze said, and an investigation into the alleged misuse was ongoing. Nguyen said of the project's use of PimEyes that: We are confident that what we did was the right thing in order to raise awareness about today's public databases and their potential consequences if people aren't aware of the tech, and personally know multiple people who have gone through this opt-out process themselves. Meta underscored that the I-XRAY tool was not unique to its product and could be used on any photo. Additionally, a spokesperson said, Meta's smart glasses featured a tamper-secure LED that alerts members of the public to when the device is recording : To be clear, Ray-Ban Meta glasses do not have facial recognition technology. From what we could see, these students simply used publicly available facial recognition software on a computer that would work with photos taken on any camera, phone or recording device. Unlike most other devices, Ray-Ban Meta glasses have an LED light that indicates to others that the user is recording. This LED cannot be disabled by the user, and we introduced tamper detection technology to prevent users from covering up the capture LED.",

    "rating": "True",
    "article_text": "Claim: Meta removed a guideline from its hateful-conduct policies on Jan. 7, 2025, that previously prohibited users from comparing women to \"household objects.\" Rating: True About this rating On Jan. 7, 2025, Meta and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced the end of the company's U.S. third-party, fact-checking program for the platforms Facebook, Instagram and Threads, saying Meta would instead move to a \"community notes\" system — a model currently used on tech entrepreneur Elon Musk's X. (Snopes left Meta's fact-checking initiative in February 2019, reporting we would not renew the partnership begun in 2016.) On the same day Meta ended the fact-checking program, it also implemented major updates to its policies on hateful conduct, doing away with some specifics regarding guidelines about prohibitive practices. In a post on the Meta Newsroom website, the company wrote, \" We will allow more speech by lifting restrictions on some topics that are part of mainstream discourse and focusing our enforcement on illegal and high-severity violations.\" One prominent example of a guideline change reported on by CNN — and later mentioned by users on Facebook , Threads and X — said Meta removed a policy previously forbidding users from comparing or generalizing women as \"household objects.\" Snopes received emails from readers who asked for the facts regarding this matter. It's true Meta removed a policy prohibiting users from comparing or generalizing women as \"household objects.\" Meta's hateful-conduct policy page displayed a change log on its left side. With the date Jan. 7, 2025, selected, the page showed additions to the document highlighted in green and removals marked with a red strike-through. One section with a red strike-through mentioned a policy against using language referencing \"women as household objects.\" The policy appeared under the section titled, \"Dehumanizing speech in the form of comparisons to or generalizations about animals, pathogens, or other sub-human life forms.\" The company originally added the \"women as household objects\" piece to its policies in a Dec. 16, 2019, update. The same section of the guidelines also displayed the removal of a line previously prohibiting users from referencing \"transgender or non-binary people as 'it.'\" Meta originally added that policy on July 30, 2020. Wired — which CNN noted first reported Meta's specific policy updates — highlighted the fact Meta also added a new line specifying the company would \"allow allegations of mental illness or abnormality when based on gender or sexual orientation, given political and religious discourse about transgenderism and homosexuality and common non-serious usage of words like 'weird.'\" Additionally, Meta's policy changes showed a red strike-through indicating the company removed guidelines forbidding generalizations regarding specific derogatory words involving mental health, among other changes. Meta's Statement to Snopes A Meta spokesperson told Snopes via email the company would continue to prohibit attacks based on protected characteristics such as ethnicity, race or religion, among others. The spokesperson also asserted it is important to distinguish between speech that is offensive and content that could potentially lead to offline violence, saying that speech may be offensive to many and adding it is not Meta's role to police offensiveness. The company's posted announcement also said, \" On platforms where billions of people can have a voice, all the good, bad and ugly is on display. But that's free expression.\" Policies Updated Days Before Trump's Inauguration CNN noted Meta's policy updates arrived \"as the company and its leader have sought to curry favor with Donald Trump and other Republicans ahead of the president-elect's second term, echoing in its announcement longstanding criticisms that Meta was 'censoring' conservative voices.\" At a news conference at U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club on Jan. 7, a reporter asked him about Meta ending its U.S. third-party, fact-checking program. In reference to Zuckerberg, the reporter asked, \"Do you think he's directly responding to the threats that you have made to him in the past?\" Trump answered , \"Probably, yeah, probably.\" (This answer occurs at the 1:05:49 mark in the below YouTube video.) CBS News reported in December 2024 about tech leaders and companies planning to donate to Trump's inaugural fund, including a $1 million payment from Meta. A MarketWatch report from January 2021 published similar information about tech-sector donations to President Joe Biden's inauguration. The report did not mention Meta, nor did the company's name appear in a list published on Biden's inaugural fund website. Meta's announcement mentioning \"free expression\" stood in similar nature to that of Musk's repeated calls for \"free speech\" on his own social media platform. CBS News reported Musk financially backed Trump's 2024 campaign to the tune of $277 million. Trump also named Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to a new initiative called the Department of Government Efficiency. The Associated Press noted that the department is \"not, despite the name, a government agency.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: An implanted microchip in the body can replace vaccine cards and will be used instead to carry COVID-19 vaccine passports. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True A Swedish company has created a digital implant that can display your COVID vaccine passport when scanned. Implanted microchips are not a new phenomenon in Sweden, and they’ve been in use before the pandemic. What's False This is not officially replacing physical cards in other countries, and users in Sweden must opt in to purchase it. Only 6,000 people in Sweden have used the microchips. Snopes is still fighting an “infodemic” of rumors and misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, and you can help.

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. As the pandemic enters its third year, many vaccinated people are getting used to the idea of carrying their proof-of-vaccination card around with them. One company in Sweden wants to make it easier by inserting microchip implants just beneath the skin that would be scanned and act as vaccine passports. Snopes readers asked us if this meant that microchips would eventually replace cards, or documents. Meanwhile, conservative American magazine The Federalist argued that this could lead to something more serious: While I doubt any population will be forcibly chipped like wayward housecats—at least not in the near future—no nightmarish policy is truly off the table. In the past 21 months, the United States has seen mandated mRNA gene therapies, QR code-based vaccine passports, mass deletion of supposed “misinformation,” and even drone surveillance to monitor social distancing. Meanwhile, more young adults died from fentanyl overdoses than from any transmissible disease. If the biosecurity state can force you to wear an obedience mask to buy groceries, what can’t they do? Resist their measures at every turn. Drag these people down from the seats of power. Dismantle the structures they’ve already put in place. Ultimately, the option to microchip has only been used by 6,000 people in Sweden — a country where such implants have actually been in use before the pandemic, and without much public fear surrounding them. The creator behind the microchip described it in an interview with AFP in December 2021. Hannes Sjobald, managing director of Dsruptive Subdermals, said, \"I have a chip implant in my arm, and I have programmed the chip so that I have my COVID passport on the chip, and the reason is that I always want to have it accessible.” He then revealed how it works by scanning his arm with his phone, which brought up a PDF with his EU Digital COVID Certificate. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heX9iVGW_fU According to France24 , at the beginning of December 2021, Sweden enacted new rules that required people to show their vaccination documents at all gatherings of 100 people or more. The estimated number of microchipped people is around 6,000 now, including those who opted to get the chip before the pandemic struck, according to EU Fact Check , a fact-checking project of the European Journalism Training Association (EJTA). Swedes have been getting microchipped for a range of reasons, and the practice became popular in 2014-2016. Thousands of people were getting these microchips implanted to make their daily lives more convenient, swiping digital scanners to access homes, offices, and gyms, and to carry emergency contact information, tickets for rail journeys, and more. According to the AFP , this implant costs 100 euros or $112. The microchip is not officially replacing vaccination documents, can be purchased only in Sweden, and is not yet widely available. Sjobald said people who can get the implant are usually curious and want to “work with this technology.” Sjobald explained to the AFP that these implants don’t have a battery, and cannot transmit signals by themselves. “So they are basically passive. They sit there asleep,\" he said. \"They can never tell your location, they're only activated when you touch them with your smartphone, so this means they cannot be used for tracking anyone's location.\" Meanwhile, some are skeptical of microchipping. Ben Libberton, a British scientist based in Sweden, told NPR in 2018, \"What is happening now is relatively safe. But if it's used everywhere, if every time you want to do something and instead of using a card you use your chip, it could be very, very easy to let go of [personal] information. \"Because it's implanted in your body, when more health-related information starts being used and incorporated into the chip and being transmitted — that could create an extra layer of privacy that we really need to look at and take care of before it's widely used,\" he added. We should note that many people across the United States now store their COVID health data on their cellphones using Apple and Google Wallet apps, and use them to get access to restaurants, public spaces, and more. While the microchips are available and in use by some people in Sweden, they are not widespread, and not available in other countries around the world, like the United States. As such, any alarmist interpretations of their usage is somewhat overblown at this moment. As such, we rate this claim as a “Mixture” of truth.

    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in early 2024 that the company plans to disable the computers of users who share \"non-mainstream content\" online. Rating: False About this rating On Feb. 3, 2024, the website The People's Voice published an article with a picture of former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates and a headline that read, \"Microsoft To Disable Computers of Users Who Share 'Non-Mainstream Content' Online.\" The story claimed, \"Microsoft has announced plans to disable the computers of people who share 'non-mainstream' content online, in an attempt to combat so-called 'misinformation' in the run-up to the 2024 election.\" The article was shared by numerous users on Facebook , Truth Social and X , just to name a few of the websites and apps where the rumor was spread online. However, this rumor was both false and misleading, despite a label next to the headline that said the story had been \"fact-checked.\" One user commented under The People's Voice article, \"Your headline has absolutely no merit based on the information you provide as context. Are you trying to mislead?\" Further, Gates, who stepped down as Microsoft's CEO in 2000 and left the company's board in 2020, was not once mentioned in the story, despite being featured in the picture below the headline. The article cited as its evidence an interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who sat down with NBC News anchor Lester Holt for a conversation about AI (artificial intelligence) in late January. At no point during the interview did Nadella say that the company planned to disable the computers of users who might share \"non-mainstream content\" online. During the first question of the interview, Nadella was asked about AI and the potential for \"fakes, fraud [and] disinformation.\" In his answer, he said of disinformation , \"The key is for us as tech platform companies is to do everything in building the guardrails from the get-go,\" and later added, \"It's about a really broader consensus in our society on how do we both, whether it's regulation or whether it's norms that we put in place, that allow us to make sure that there's safety from the get-go.\" Moments later and during another answer, Nadella said that Microsoft was already in the practice of \"watermarking and detecting deepfakes and content IDs.\" He then mentioned both misinformation and disinformation but did not say anything about disabling people's computers, as was claimed by the false rumor. NBC News published a YouTube video that contained a short, edited version of the interview that aired during the \"NBC Nightly News\" newscast on Jan. 30. A long and more detailed answer was found by Snopes in the extended interview that was only made available online. The transcript of the relevant portion of the extended interview is presented below in its original, word-for-word form: HOLT: AI feels new to most of us who really kind of discovered its potential within the last year or so. But we talk about the exciting things, detecting and perhaps treating cancer. And then we talk about the worrisome thing. Fakes, fraud, disinformation. We've seen that already in the political arena. Does it give you pause as to what the potential and how far you can take this? NADELLA: Absolutely, in the sense that, one of the things that I feel that's very healthy is we're not just talking about all of the things this new technology can do in terms of driving productivity or helping us reduce drudgery even in our everyday work and all of the benefits. But we're also talking about the unintended consequences. If anything, I think, we have learned even as a tech industry, is that we have to simultaneously address both of these. How do you really amplify the benefits and damper the unintended consequences? So, I welcome the dialogue and let's take say, disinformation, right, as one area. The key is for us as tech platform companies to do everything in building the guardrails from the get-go. And, but by the way, this is not just about tech platforms and tech companies, but it's about a really broader consensus in our society on how do we both, whether it's regulation or whether it's norms that we put in place, that allow us to make sure that there's safety from the get-go. HOLT: We're marching down the road to the first AI election. Are you holding your breath to see how AI can help and how it may be weaponized? NADELLA: In fact, it goes back again, [but] this is not the first election where we dealt with disinformation or propaganda campaigns by adversaries and election interference and all of those things. So therefore, I think, what we have to go back again as, for example, I think we are doing all of the work across the tech industry around watermarking and detecting deepfakes and content IDs. There's going to be enough and more technology, quite frankly, in order to be able to identify the issues around disinformation and misinformation. Then, the question again comes back to, where's the ... how do we build consensus between parties [and] candidates, and the norms around what's acceptable [or] not acceptable? Readers can watch Holt's full, extended interview with Nadella for themselves in two parts on the NBC News website. The news organization also published an article that reported the facts of the interview.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Microsoft announced it was starting human trials in June 2022 on a microchip that will store COVID-19 information. Rating: Labeled Satire About this rating In January 2022, a rumor started to circulate on social media that Microsoft was about to start human trials for a microchip that could store COVID-19 vaccination information. This message reads: \"Human trials will start this July on a micro-chip implant smaller than a pin-head that will hold your booster status and other information to enable a fast and easy way to access things like shops and events. All powered by Microsoft technology. A very exciting technology.\" This is not a genuine news item. It originated with a parody account. The satirical nature of this Twitter account can be discovered by reading its tongue-in-cheek biography about an MP \"who definitely shouldn't be in jail for corruption in public office.\" The bio also contains the word \"parody.\" Furthermore, while the account features a photograph of British MP Matt Hancock, the name displayed on the account is \"Hatt Mancock,\" a humorous spoonerism . While Microsoft — a company that has been repeatedly maligned throughout the COVID-19 pandemic by false and unfounded rumors — is not set to begin human trials on a COVID-19 vaccine microchip passport, the idea of a biometric passport isn't far-fetched. A Swedish company, for example, has truly developed a microchip that can be implanted beneath the skin. Thousands of Swedes have voluntarily opted to have this chip implanted in their arms in order to keep proof of their vaccination status (and other personal information) with them at all times. Though still rare, several thousand Swedes have opted to have an electronic implant inserted under the skin in recent years, eliminating the need to remember key fobs, business cards, public transport cards, and recently: vaccine passes ... \"I have a chip implant in my arm and I have programmed the chip so that I have my COVID-19 passport on the chip and the reason is that I always want to have it accessible and when I read my chip, I just swipe my phone on the chip and then I unlock and it opens up,\" said Hannes Sjoblad, managing director of DSruptive Subdermals, as a PDF with his vaccine certificate appeared on his phone. Today We Learned ... In the course of researching this article, we learned that \"spoonerism,\" the transposition of the initial sound of two or more words , was named after William Archibald Spooner , a priest and long-serving don at Oxford University who would, on occasion, accidentally utter unintentionally humorous phrases , such as \"it is kisstomary to cuss the bride\" (it is customary to kiss the bride), \"You have hissed all my mystery lectures\" (you have missed all my history lectures) and \"you have tasted two worms\" (you have wasted two terms). While spoonerisms are truly named after Spooner, not all of the phrases attributed to him have been verified.",

    "article_text": "Claim: The silhouette of a person's head used as the default profile icon for Microsoft Outlook 2010 was based on a police mug shot taken of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in 1977. Rating: Research In Progress About this rating The outline of the default profile icon for Microsoft Outlook's 2010 program has long been compared to the silhouette of a 1977 mugshot of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. We looked into the claim and found that while the similarity is striking, neither Microsoft nor Gates himself has officially responded to the claim, much less confirmed its accuracy. In 1977, Bill Gates was arrested in Albuquerque, New Mexico for running a red light and driving without a license. The Harvard drop-out was 21 or 22 at the time, and he publicly spoke about the incident in a 2007 profile for Time Magazine . More than 30 years later, Microsoft Outlook 2010 was released. Within months, a site called Ars Technica published a piece [archived here ] pointing out the similarity between the two outlines, including a side by side visual comparison. (arstechnica.com) The Ars Technica article made the following assertion: That isn't just anyone's silhouette, however. Our eagle-eyed editor-in-chief, Ken Fisher, noticed that the silhouette has a striking resemblance to one William H. Gates III. Quite how he noticed this is anybody's guess—we suspect he has a framed picture of the Microsoft founder and philanthropist mounted on his wall. And it's not just any old picture of Bill Gates that some cheeky Outlook developer has used. Oh no. It's a picture from one of the man's finest moments. It's the picture taken in Albuquerque, New Mexico, way back in 1977, when he was arrested for a driving offense, the exact nature of which is lost to the sands of time. It's the man's mug-shot. Over the years, numerous posts have made the same claim on multiple sites, including Reddit , Instagram , and Facebook . View this post on Instagram A post shared by UNILAD (@unilad) From our own previous investigation , we know that the mugshot itself is authentic. The Microsoft Outlook 2010 default profile icon is also authentic; it can be found on an official Microsoft webpage . (We don't know exactly when Microsoft stopped using the silhouette for this purpose, but it is absent from the 2021 release of Outlook.) (learn.microsoft.com) We reached out to Microsoft for confirmation, and have not yet received a response, as of this writing. This story will be updated upon receiving confirmation or comment from Microsoft. In sum, because neither Microsoft nor Gates himself has publicly addressed this speculation and we have not yet received a response confirming or denying the similarity of the two images, this claim is rated \"Research in Progress.\"",

Rating: Mostly False About this rating What's True Microsoft published a patent for a \"cryptocurrency system using body activity data.\" This patent is filed under the number WO2020060606A1. What's False The number WO2020060606A1 contains three \"6's\" but is obviously not the same as \"666.\" This patent focuses on tracking body activity via wearable technology, such as a smart watch, and makes no mention of implanted microchips.

The spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease in 2020 sparked a flurry of conspiracy theories concerning where it originated , how it spread, and who was responsible for it. One such theory blamed the disease on Bill Gates and claimed that the former Microsoft CEO had started a pandemic so that he could insert microchips into people around the globe under the guise of providing vaccinations or for other purposes. This conspiracy theory is propped up by little more than coincidences and misinterpretations. For instance, in April 2020 social media users started to share a link to a patent supposedly owned by Microsoft that pertained to the micro-chipping of individuals for financial gain. This patent was especially insidious, users claimed, because it carried the numbers \"666,\" the biblical \"mark of the beast,\" and the letters WO, which they claimed stood for the \"World Order.\" The above-displayed screenshots pertain to a genuine patent filed by Microsoft. However, this patent does not involve a plan to microchip individuals, \"WO\" does not stand for World Order, and one has to ignore the existence of 11 other characters in order to arrive at the conclusion that this patent carries the devil's number. This patent is for a \"cryptocurrency system\" that \"uses body activity data.\" Microsoft Technology Licensing applied for this patent in June 2019, and the patent was published a few months later in March 2020 under the number \" WO2020060606A1 .\" The patent, which has not been granted as of this writing, makes no mention of microchips. The diagrams included in this patent (and shown in the screenshots above) show how the \"person,\" \"user device,\" and \"sensor\" are all distinct items. The text of the patent further explains that the \"user device\" in the diagram may include wearables, such as a smart watch, or cell phones, laptops, or tablets: User device 130 may include any device capable of processing and storing data/information and communicating over communication network 120. For example, user device 130 may include personal computers, servers, cell phones, tablets, laptops, smart devices (e.g. smart watches or smart televisions). An exemplary embodiment of user device 130 is illustrated in FIG. 6. The patent provides two options for the sensor. First, the sensor could be incorporated into one of the aforementioned devices, such as a smartphone. The \"sensor\" may also be its own standalone component: Sensor 140 may be configured to sense the body activity of user 145. As illustrated in FIG. 1, sensor 140 may be a separate component from user device 130 and be operably and/or communicatively connected to user device 130. Alternatively, sensor 140 may be included and integrated in user device 130. For example, user device 130 may be a wearable device having sensor 140 therein. The sensor 140 may transmit information/data to user device 130. At no point in this patent does Microsoft suggest that the sensor would be a microchip implanted into a person's skin. So what about the claim that this is World Order patent 666? As we noted above, this patent was truly published under the number \" WO2020060606A1.\" It truly contains the number 666 (or, more accurately, 060606). However \"patent WO2020060606A1\" is not the same as \"patent 666.\" Furthermore, the \"WO\" at the start of this patent does not stand for \"World Order.\" It is shorthand for WIPO, the World Intellectual Property Organization, which issued this patent. The \"A1\" at the end of this patent number signifies that this is only a published patent. The \" kind code \" B1 is applied to granted patents. We reached out to Microsoft for more information about this patent and will update this article if we hear back. To sum up: Microsoft has applied for a patent that deals with the development of a cryptocurrency system based on tracking body-activity data. However, this patent focuses on wearable technology, such as a smart watch, not implanted microchips, and while patent number \"WO2020060606A1\" contains three \"6's,\" this appears to be little more than a coincidence.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A patent granted to Microsoft describes a chatbot that enables users to talk to a specific person, alive or dead, based on data gathered from the person’s social media, messages, voice recordings, images, written letters, and more. Rating: Mostly True About this rating What's True Microsoft was granted a patent to develop a chatbot to converse in the personality of a specific person, using their social data. This includes people both living and dead. What's False There are no plans to develop this technology at Microsoft as of this writing. Real-life technology may be more like an episode of the Netflix show \"Black Mirror\" than we realize. A chatbot that could be developed by Microsoft is remarkably similar to technology seen in an episode of the science fiction show that allowed a character to talk to an artificial version of her deceased partner. In December 2020, Microsoft was granted a patent for a chatbot that allows users to have a virtual conversation with any specific person, living or dead. According to the filing from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), this could be a \"past or present entity ... such as a friend, a relative, an acquaintance, a celebrity, a fictional character, a historical figure.” However, in a tweet posted in January 2021, Tim O’Brien, Microsoft's general manager of Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs, said, “there’s no plan for this. But if I ever get a job writing for Black Mirror, I’ll know to go to the USPTO website for story ideas.” (The \"Black Mirror\" episode in question, \" Be Right Back ,\" aired in 2013 , years before Microsoft applied for the patent.) He said in a separate tweet that Microsoft applied for this patent in April 2017, which “predates the AI ethics reviews we do today (I sit on the panel), and I'm not aware of any plan to build/ship (and yes, it's disturbing).” According to the patent filing , social data would be accessed using “images, voice data, electronic messages, social media posts, written letters” to modify a “special index in the theme of the specific person’s personality. The special index may be used to train a chat bot to converse and interact in the personality of the specific person.” While this chatbot may not be in development, the patent was indeed granted to Microsoft on Dec. 1, 2020 . We thus rate this claim as “Mostly True.”",

    "article_text": "Claim: A viral post in April 2024 accurately claimed a person checking out his old neighborhood on Google Earth found a man missing for 22 years dead in a pond. Rating: True About this rating In April 2024, a post on Reddit carried an aerial image of a house near a pond with a caption claiming a person checking out his old neighborhood on Google Earth found a man who'd been missing for two decades dead: In 1997, William Moldt disappeared after leaving a club to go home. He wasn't found until 2019 when a man using Google Earth to check out his old neighborhood in Florida discovered a car submerged in a pond. The post received 51,000 upvotes and 1,100 comments, as of this writing. A user on X also made the claim in January 2024, with more details ( archived ): The satellite images revealed the guy's car submerged in the shallows of a lake. This is a true story. In August 2019, a former resident of the neighborhood of Grand Isles in Wellington, Florida, was examining his old area on Google Earth, when a white shape in a pond caught his eye. He took screen shots and sent them to his ex-wife, who still lived there. According to The Palm Beach Post , the woman recognized her neighbor Barry Fay's house and the pond behind it, and she forwarded the images to him, asking if he could see anything. While he could see a shape that looked like a car on the screen shots, he could not see anything while standing on the edge of the pond. So he enlisted another neighbor, who owned a drone, to take more pictures over the water. Those images clearly showed a car just beneath the surface. The neighbors then called the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office, who arrived that evening and worked into the night to pull the car out of the pond. In it, they found skeletal remains, confirmed two weeks later as those of William Moldt, who had disappeared one night in 1997. Moldt, reportedly a 40-year-old mortgage broker and Lantana, Florida, resident, had called his girlfriend around 9:30 p.m., saying he would be heading home soon. Witnesses last saw him as he left a nightclub around 11 p.m. that night.",

    "article_text": "Claim: U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks posted an image on Twitter that revealed his Gmail password. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True A viral image that supposedly revealed the Gmail password and pin number of Alabama congressman Mo Brooks is genuine and truly originated with Brooks' Twitter account. However ... What's Undetermined We can't confirm that this was the congressman's current password when it was posted. One indication that it may have been an old, non-working password is that it was accompanied by the year 2020, not 2021. On June 6, 2021, California congressman Eric Swalwell served a lawsuit to Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks in an attempt to hold the Alabama representative accountable for his alleged role in the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6. When Brooks responded to the lawsuit on Twitter, he included a photograph of his computer screen that was open to a page about Alabama's laws. While Brooks claimed that Swalwell broke the law by \"sneaking into my house\" — something Swalwell's team denies — many social media users were more concerned with what appeared in the bottom right-hand corner of the image: A set of characters supposedly revealing Brooks' Gmail password. This is a genuine picture that was posted to Brooks' account. At the time of this writing, which is about 20 hours after the message was posted, it was still available on Brooks' account . Brooks did post a second photograph of his computer screen, this time with the alleged password cropped out of the image. But he has yet to delete the original message. While this image is genuine and truly originated with Brooks, we can't say for certain that this photograph revealed the congressman's current Gmail password. For one, the photograph also included the words \"New 2020,\" which seemingly indicates that these passwords were new in 2020. It's possible that they have been changed since then. We reached out to the congressman for more information and we will update this article accordingly. Swalwell sued former President Donald Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr., adviser Rudy Giuliani, and Brooks in an attempt to hold them accountable for inciting an attempted insurrection. The lawsuit reads in part: \"The Defendants, in short, convinced the mob that something was occurring that -- if actually true -- might indeed justify violence, and then sent that mob to the Capitol with violence-laced calls for immediate action.\" But Swalwell's team ran into difficulties in its attempts to serve the lawsuit to Brooks, as the Republican congressman was reportedly avoiding them. Fox News reported : Attorneys for Rep. Eric Swalwell hired a private investigator to look for Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., to serve him with the California Democrat's lawsuit, but have been unable to locate him despite spending \"many hours over many days\" on the hunt, according to a new court filing. On June 6, Swalwell's team successfully served Brooks with the lawsuit. While the Alabama congressman claimed that Swalwell's team acted illegally by entering his home, Philip Andonian, an attorney for Swalwell, denied this to CNN : \"No one entered or even attempted to enter the Brooks' house. That allegation is completely untrue. A process server lawfully served the papers on Mo Brooks' wife, as the federal rules allow.\"",

    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: A mountain lion broke into a Colorado Springs, Colorado, pet store and rolled around in catnip on May 4, 2022. Rating: False About this rating A rumor that circulated online in September 2025 claimed that a mountain lion broke into a pet store in Colorado Springs, only to be found by employees the next morning rolling around in a pile of catnip. Snopes readers emailed us to ask whether the rumor was true. The most popular instance of the story appeared on the Facebook page StoryTime ( archived ), receiving over 192,000 reactions. The post displayed a picture of a mountain lion entering an aisle, with another inset image showing it rolling around in catnip. The story featured the following headline: \"Mountain lion breaks into pet store, finds catnip aisle.\" This rumor appeared in numerous Facebook posts and spread to other social media sites such as X ( archived ). Some of those posts ( archived ) featured links leading to articles hosted by WordPress blogs, such as one advertisement-filled story hosted on the ifeg.info ( archived ) website . The posts all told the same story: In Colorado Springs, a local pet store was preparing for its morning rush of customers when workers found an unexpected guest. Security footage revealed a mountain lion had slipped in overnight, padding silently through the aisles like it owned the place. It ignored the dog food, skipped past the bird seed, and made a beeline straight for one section: cat toys. After sniffing around, the big cat stopped at the catnip shelf, pawed a bag down, ripped it open, and immediately flopped onto the floor. Rolling back and forth, it rubbed its face and paws in the catnip, completely intoxicated by its new discovery. When employees unlocked the doors, they were stunned to find the \"customer\" sprawled out in the toy aisle, surrounded by shredded bags of catnip. Wildlife officers carefully coaxed the lion outside before relocating it back into the nearby hills. Experts explained that while mountain lions aren't known for reacting to catnip like housecats, curiosity and the strong scent could have triggered its playful behavior. When asked about the situation, the store owner just smirked: \"Colorado's known for its plants making folks feel good, guess now we know the animals are into it too.\" However, a Google search for \" Colorado mountain lion store catnip \" found no news outlets reporting about a mountain lion breaking into a pet store in Colorado Springs, let alone playing with catnip. Prominent news outlets would have widely reported this rumor, if true. Although Sightengine , a tool for detecting artificial intelligence (AI)-generated images , did not flag the image shared in the posts as AI, other elements made it suspicious. (It's worth noting that AI image detectors are not always accurate.) For example, in the image, the mountain lion appeared to be in a grocery store snack aisle rather than a cat toy aisle at a pet store, as described in the story. A TinEye search of the image led to a viral video ( archived ) of a robbery taking place in a Canadian convenience store, featuring a shot of an aisle that looked similar to one in the image. When directly compared, the perspective and contents of both images appeared nearly identical, down to having the same snacks in the exact same spots. It appeared that an unknown individual may have edited the original image (or another one from the convenience store) to include the mountain lion, then cropped it to remove any visible watermarks, resulting in the image associated with the rumor. The below collage shows a comparison of the aisle as it appeared in the video (on the left) and the image that circulated with the posts about the mountain lion. (Facebook page StoryTime/YouTube channel ITV News) The timestamp on the image was equally suspicious, displaying May 4, 2022, but there was no evidence that the image appeared online until the StoryTime page's Sept. 15, 2025 post, the earliest example we found. If this event occurred in 2022, it would have been widely publicized at that time rather than being reported on for the first time three years later. Rather, the person or people who authored the story seemingly fabricated the whole thing as one of countless amusing tales depicting wild animals in uncharacteristic, unexpected situations that circulate online. Many of these stories can be characterized as \" AI slop, \" low-quality, AI-generated content designed to encourage clicks and shares. Unusual or surprising stories involving wild animals are one common type of slop. The individuals who generate and spread these stories aim to earn advertising revenue on websites linked from the aforementioned Facebook posts. Although there was no evidence of a direct connection, the Facebook pages and the blog with the longer version of the story both matched patterns we identified in a story investigating a rash of AI slop stories about the alleged charitable actions of celebrities in the wake of the deadly July 2025 floods in Texas. For example, although the mountain lion story was about the U.S., one of the pages that posted it was traced back to Tbilisi, Georgia. Meanwhile, the blog featured examples of writing in Vietnamese, but the website registrant's address traced back to a shopping plaza in Phoenix, Arizona. A Google search for the address brought up a number of similar sites, as well as scam warnings from internet users, suggesting the sites' owners likely used this address to hide their actual location. This is not the first time Snopes has investigated a claim popularized by the StoryTime page. For further reading, Snopes previously investigated a claim from the same page about an \"AI robot\" being afraid of a lion and found it to be false.",

The idea is that if you never break anything, you're probably not moving fast enough.\" Rating: Correct Attribution About this rating Facebook first launched for a small number of college students in 2004. At its inception, the company's software programmers had a motto while developing the platform that was simply known as, \"Move fast and break things.\" In 2012, just as Facebook was preparing to go public on the stock market, Zuckerberg penned a letter to potential investors. Within that letter, he included \" five core values \" for how he claimed his employees ran the company. One of those five values was titled, \"Move Fast\": Move Fast Moving fast enables us to build more things and learn faster. However, as most companies grow, they slow down too much because they're more afraid of making mistakes than they are of losing opportunities by moving too slowly. We have a saying: 'Move fast and break things.' The idea is that if you never break anything, you're probably not moving fast enough. In a video included in a two-part \"Frontline\" documentary titled, \" The Facebook Dilemma ,\" a younger Zuckerberg is seen talking in a college lecture hall. In the clip, he says, \"And a lot of times people are just, like, too careful. I think it's more useful to, like make things happen, and then, like, apologize later, than it is to make sure you dot all your i's now, and then, like just not get stuff done.\" \"The promise of Facebook was to create a more open and connected world,\" the \"Frontline\" documentary's synopsis read. \"But from the company’s failure to protect millions of users’ data, to the proliferation of 'fake news' and disinformation, mounting crises have raised the question: Is Facebook more harmful than helpful?\" In sum, yes, Zuckerberg did once write and likely say the words, \"Move fast and break things,\" and, \"The idea is that if you never break anything, you're probably not moving fast enough.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: TikTok's settings allow unauthorized users to obtain the personal contact details of other users who have not made their details public. Rating: False About this rating Social media and chat apps have long been a cause of concern for parents and adults, as well as a source of viral online warnings about the dangers to children of cyber-predators. Sexual predators and pedophiles do use such apps to target and contact children and young teens (as we have examined previously), but the claims made in viral Facebook warnings are often overstated or even erroneous -- children can usually protect themselves from the unwanted attention of strangers by using the privacy settings that come with most popular apps, as well as by taking a general approach of caution and skepticism about would-be contacts or \"friends.\" In early 2019, a viral Facebook message warned about the purported dangers of TikTok, the most popular example of a recent wave of short-video social media apps, including Snapchat, Dubsmash and (prior to 2016) Vine: \"If your child has MUSICALLY/TIK TOK, make them delete it now! Friday night, [my daughter] got a text from a Pennsylvania number. They knew her name, age, where she lived and her email. We took her phone to Verizon and they said it was the most dangerous app. Even with her account being set to private, they can still access all of her information.\" This warning was further promulgated on Facebook when it was re-posted on 12 February: It is possible for someone to obtain a phone number, email address, or other personal information about a TikTok user, but only if the TikTok user in question shares such information. As such, the February 2019 viral Facebook message was fundamentally mistaken in the focus of its warning, suggesting as it did that the app's settings -- rather than the actions of its users -- allowed potentially predatory adults to access contact details that a child did not allow to be shared. Background TikTok is a wildly popular mobile app that allows users to record and share videos of up to 15 seconds in length. In August 2018, it replaced the rebranded Musical.ly app in the United States after that app was acquired by the Chinese company ByteDance. TikTok is especially popular among teens, who typically use it to post videos of themselves singing along to their favorite songs, short comedy sketches, or a variety of viral \"challenges.\" Some commentators have praised TikTok as being genuinely good fun and inclusive of eclectic interests and subcultures, and the New York Times hailed it for its relatively low levels of bullying and harassment, saying TikTok \"might well be the only truly pleasant social network in existence.\" However, others have pointed out that the fame-seeking, music-video ethos of the app has given rise to an uncomfortable trend of young teens' engaging in sexually suggestive dancing and behavior, and still others have highlighted the fact that TikTok's relatively young user base means sexual predators and pedophiles have been known to pose as teens and engage in grooming on the app. Privacy and safety When signing up for a TikTok account, a user is asked to provide their phone number or email address, as well as their date of birth. (The app does not allow users who state their age as being under 13 years old to register.) TikTok does not request the user's city, state, or country of residence. The app texts or emails the user a four-digit verification code in order to complete the account setup. TikTok users can follow and add each other as friends and send each other private messages, but one user cannot successfully send another user a message until both users have \"followed\" each other and thereby become \"friends.\" Users cannot attach videos or photographs to private messages. (We tested these restrictions using two dummy accounts.) After the registration process is complete, a TikTok user's account is set to \"public\" by default. This means that any videos that user might post will, in principle, be visible to any other users, except for those whom the posting user has blocked . However, a TikTok user can switch their account to private (which means only approved users can view their videos), and they can adjust their privacy settings in other ways -- for example, determining whether everyone can leave comments under their videos, whether only friends can comment, or whether no one can: Most important, a TikTok user's \"bio\" -- which typically contains a brief description of the user, their age, and their interests -- is visible to everyone even if the user's account is set to \"private,\" but the user alone decides what information to include in their bio. The phone number or email address that a user employed to register an account does not automatically show up in their TikTok profile or in their bio. That personal information is only used by TikTok or verification purposes in setting up the account in the first place. The February 2019 warning For all the reasons we have outlined, the suggestion made in the viral February 2019 Facebook warning is simply not plausible. TikTok's privacy and security restrictions do not allow for one user's personal information -- such as age, email address, phone number. or location -- to become obtainable to another user on TikTok, unless the first user shared that information (whether knowingly or inadvertently). We tested this by setting up two dummy TikTok accounts, giving both the most permissive privacy settings available, and causing each to add the other as a friend. Despite that combination, neither account was able to view the phone number, email address, location, or date of birth/age relating to the other account. We then went even further, linking one TikTok account to an existing Instagram account and YouTube account. The second TikTok account was still not able to view the email address, phone number, or date of birth associated with the first TikTok account's now-linked Instagram account, nor the location associated with the first TikTok account's now-linked YouTube account. A spokesperson for TikTok confirmed these findings. We asked whether it was possible, under any privacy setting, for one TikTok user to obtain the email address, phone number, age, or location of another TikTok user simply because the second TikTok user provided that information to the app when setting up an account. The spokesperson wrote in response that \"No privacy setting would enable or facilitate this.\" We asked whether linking one TikTok account to an Instagram or YouTube account could conceivably mean that the personal information pertaining to the Instagram or YouTube account would then become available to someone viewing the user's TikTok account. In reply, the company's spokesperson wrote: \"No, this scenario would not be possible. When you move from TikTok to another app, like Instagram or YouTube, you follow the settings of that app, including the user's account privacy settings.\" Of course, someone could obtain the phone number, age, email address, or location of a TikTok user if that TikTok user posted the information in their bio, in a comment, in a video, or in a private message. A user might even inadvertently share their personal information by, for example, having an envelope or piece of paper containing their phone number or address visible in the background of a video. However, in such a scenario the sharing of the personal information would be due to the actions of the TikTok user, not the app's settings. We contacted the woman who originally posted the warning to Facebook on 11 February. She confirmed that her daughter had been texted by an unrecognized number and that this action formed the basis of her Facebook post. When we inquired how she was able to determine that this text contact had been the result of details shared via TikTok, the woman answered it was \"because that is the only 'social media' app she has.\" The woman added that she was \"100% positive that [her daughter] did not give out her number.\" We cannot determine what happened in the case of the woman's daughter, but it is possible that the person who texted her acquired her phone number, first name, and location from a third party or mutual acquaintance. But as far as we could determine, it is not possible that the person who texted the girl obtained her personal contact details simply by viewing her TikTok profile unless the girl had herself made those details publicly available.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk once said that Mackenzie Scott, novelist, philanthropist and ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, was \"destroying Western civilization.\" Rating: Correct Attribution About this rating Context Musk wrote in response to a post on X that, \"'Super rich ex-wives who hate their former spouse'\" should be listed among \"'Reasons that Western Civilization died.'\" That post said of Scott's philanthropic efforts that \"over half of the orgs to which she's donated so far deal with issues of race and/or gender.\" Musk later deleted his post. In November 2024, claims circulated that Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk had once accused novelist and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, of destroying \"western civilization.\" For example, the claim appeared on a Reddit post ( archived ): (Lonely_Version_8135/Reddit) The post included an image that read: elon musk said Bezos' ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott is destroying western civilization by donating billions to charity for women, minorities and marginalized groups, so in response she doubled her donations. Perfect response. As of this writing, the post had gained 2,200 upvotes. Further, Snopes readers sought to confirm the claim in repeated searches, asking if Musk had indeed made this accusation against Scott. The claim is correct. In an X post dated March 6, 2024, Musk accused Scott of being a reason \"Western Civilization died.\" As Snopes reported in March 2024 , Scott is an outspoken philanthropist who said she intended to give away her fortune. Her website includes an updated list of organizations to which she has donated over the years. The post on X, now deleted, was archived and is still available for viewing . Snopes also saved a screen capture: Elon Musk post (X/Elon Musk) \"Super rich ex-wives who hate their former spouse\" should filed [sic] be listed among \"Reasons that Western Civilization died\" While he didn't directly name Scott in his post, he was referring to her. H e was replying to another X post, also deleted but preserved in the internet archive , that listed the causes to which Scott had focused on donating, according to the list on her website: (X/@eyelasho) Who is Bezos' ex giving money to? According to her fund's website, over half of the orgs to which she's donated so far deal with issues of race and/or gender. Her fund ought to be called The AWFL Fund. It's the ultimate aspirational expression of the most awful group in the US. Musk Had Criticized Scott Before This was not the first time Musk spoke out against Scott. In May 2022, he also criticized her for her philanthropic efforts, accusing her of donating to Democrats, whom he perceived were attacking Tesla ( archived ): True. Tesla was attacked by Romney in 2 of 3 presidential debates. Those lines were fed to him by a particular individual in the oil & gas industry. The Dems turned negative over the past ~12 months. At least part of it is Mackenzie's donation to PACs posing as charities. In the same exchange, he then suggested Scott was turning on all tech industry moguls so as to retaliate against her ex-husband, Bezos ( archived ): Yes. It's safe to say that Mackenzie [ahem] Scott is not exactly a big fan of her ex-husband. Unfortunately, a lot of others are getting caught in the crossfire.",

    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: X owner Elon Musk announced his endorsement of U.S. President Joe Biden for reelection, came out as transgender and died of suicide over a two-day period in early October 2023. Rating: False About this rating On Oct. 5, 2023, a user on X named Armand Domalewski posted that the social media platform's owner, Elon Musk, had announced his endorsement of U.S. President Joe Biden for a second term in the White House. \"Elon Musk endorses Joe Biden for re-election,\" the post read alongside a picture of Musk smiling. However, this news was not true. Domalewski had created the post ( archived ) as somewhat of a satirical example of a recent decision made by X that removes visible headlines from posts that contain links. The link in the post, which was only displayed as \"Fortune.com,\" led to an article with a headline that could only be read if users visited the website. That headline: \"Elon Musk plans to remove headlines from news articles shared on X.\" Musk previously posted ( archived ) that the decision to remove headlines came directly from him and that he believed the change \"will greatly improve the esthetics\" of posts. Domalewski told us via a DM on X, \"I think it is telling that even though I made what seemed to me to be an extremely obviously joke, there were still a not insignificant number of people who accepted it at face value. That seems…bad.\" In another one of his examples, Domalewski posted ( archived ), \"Ellen Musk, formerly Elon, comes out as transgender.\" The image displayed only \"Axios.com,\" and again, the headline for the article wasn't visible. Once the image was clicked, users would see that the headline on Axios.com read, \"Musk says X discourages links in posts.\" Domalewski continued: \"A huge reason why people stay on this platform is for news. If people who write the news have no incentive to post here, it's going to strangle the quality of the platform.\" He also called the decision by X \"annoying,\" saying, \"I have to click on an article link to even find out what it's about. Just… why?\" A different X user named @ACABylonBee also created a post ( archived ) to display how easily users might be misled with an article's headline no longer being visible. The post read, \"Elon Musk found dead at Twitter HQ of apparent suicide.\" This post led to the same Fortune.com article also used by Domalewski. In other words, no, Musk hadn't endorsed Biden, come out as transgender or died of suicide. Some readers might wonder what the removal of visible headlines might mean for the future of X, that is, if the policy isn't reversed in the near future. The Associated Press reported about how different of a world the social media platform has become for journalists who are looking to bring news to the platform's users: Under Twitter's previous leadership, journalists — no matter how small their outlet — could receive a blue checkmark next to their username that verified they were who they said they were. Celebrities and other public figures could also receive a verification. That changed when Musk ended the verification process and Twitter started doling out blue checkmarks to anyone who wanted one — without verifying their identity — as long as they pay a monthly subscription fee. Musk has also gutted the team that had been responsible for moderating the content flowing across the platform, temporarily suspended accounts of journalists and has appeared to throttle, or slow down access to links, to media sites such as The New York Times. Ben Collins, a senior reporter for NBC News who has written extensively about online disinformation efforts, posted of X's decision to remove headlines from posts, \"We're in an information war and information is losing — because the only people who know we're in one are trying to kill it.\"",

However, we're not sure if anyone predicted Musk tweeting, \"I propose a literal dick measuring contest,\" a tweet that ended with an emoji of a straight ruler. Whether joking or not, this was a real tweet posted by Musk from his official @elonmusk Twitter account on July 9, 2023. The tweet was a response to an earlier tweet also from Musk that read, \"Zuck is a cuck.\" I propose a literal dick measuring contest ? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 10, 2023 Since we know that not all users are familiar with the definitions of every word used on social media, here are the ways that Merriam-Webster.com described the word \"cuck\": 1: a man whose wife is unfaithful : CUCKOLD 2: (informal, disparaging + often offensive) : a weak or submissive man —often used as an insulting and contemptuous term for a man who has politically progressive or moderate views To give an idea of how unexpected the \"dick-measuring contest\" tweet was to some users, we'll turn to a tweet from a popular Musk parody account, @ElonMuskAOC. The user behind the parody account tweeted about the \"Zuck is a cuck\" and \"dick-measuring contest\" tweets, \"At this point, I can't keep track of which account I'm tweeting from,\" a joke that implied Musk himself was in control of the parody account. Musk even replied to the parody tweet from his official account, adding, \"Same.\" Same — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 10, 2023 For more details about the possibility of a cage match between Musk and Zuckerberg , we recommend our previous fact check that looked at whether Zuckerberg had tweeted to Musk, \"Speaking of cheating, you had an affair with Sergey Brin's wife last year.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: Elon Musk tweeted that Twitter would be implementing yellow star badges to verify users of the Jewish faith. Rating: Originated as Satire About this rating On Nov. 7, 2022, a screenshot of a tweet was posted on Reddit with the caption, \"Oh no.\" The tweet appeared to come from Twitter owner Elon Musk and said that Twitter would be implementing yellow star badges as \"a special verification for users of the Jewish faith.\" However, this tweet did not come from Musk. The tweet featured in the screenshot originated on a Twitter account named @ArgumentsValid that used the display name \"Elon Musk\" with Musk's current profile picture. The account's bio said that it publishes parody. The satirical tweet played on two separate subjects. First, there was the fact that Musk had announced plans for Twitter to implement a new paid subscription plan for users to receive a verification badge, among other purported perks. This plan brought with it a bit of controversy over the potential for impersonation. Second, the crux of the tweet alluded to the fact that Jews throughout Nazi-occupied Europe were forced to wear a badge in the form of a yellow star as a means of identification, as published by The British Library Board. After only seven hours, the Reddit thread on the r/WhitePeopleTwitter subreddit showed over 51,000 points. This meant that it was one of the most popular posts on the entire website for the day. The thread displayed a small \"Satire / Fake Tweet\" label. However, that label wasn't added until over two hours after the thread was posted, according to a message from one of the subreddit's moderators. A search of Facebook found that the screenshot of the satirical tweet was being shared as if it was a real message that came from Musk. One user posted, \"JUST LIKE THEY WORE THE STAR ON THEIR CLOTHES IN GERMANY! IT WAS USED NOT TO HELP TREAT THEM BETTER BUT TO TREAT THEM WORSE..... WHY DOESN'T ANYONE PAY ATTENTION TO HISTORY!!!!\" Another user said, \"Pretty sure this has been tried before,\" referring to yellow stars worn by Jews during World War II. At the same time, some other Facebook users realized it was a joke. One user posted, \"Trolling Elon is getting out of hand.\" A second person also shared the tweet screenshot and said, \"Ok, Facebook, we will try satire once again.\"",

Rating: Labeled Satire About this rating A rumor that SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed SpaceX had been working on a satellite that controls the weather circulated widely online. For example, the Facebook page America's Last Line of Defense (ALLOD) posted on Oct. 9, 2024: Elon says SpaceX has been working for years on a satellite that manipulates weather events to \"compete\" with NASA. (Facebook/America's Last Line of Defense) Some readers seemed to interpret rumor as a factual recounting of real-life events, and at least 450 of them reshared the claim. However, there was no evidence that either NASA or SpaceX were seeking to control the weather in 2024. Rather, the rumor about SpaceX's supposed program originated with ALLOD — a social media account that describes its output as being humorous or satirical in nature. Its main Facebook page states: The flagship of the ALLOD network of trollery. Nothing on this page is real. The fictional story spread as conspiracy theories about the government's ability to control the weather spread online. These started after U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican congresswoman from Georgia, posted such a claim on X ( archived ), a lie that gained 43.5 million views as of this writing: (X/@mtgreenee) ALLOD has a history of making up stories for shares and comments, sometimes relying on artificial-intelligence (AI) writing software to do its storytelling. Snopes has addressed similar satirical claims created by ALLOD in the past, including the assertion that Musk was suing Kathy Griffin and a rumor that the streaming service Disney+ had lost 23 million subscribers after it tried to \"cancel\" Musk.

    "article_text": "Claim: A news website published a serious article with a headline that read, \"Musk's Twitter Takeover Threatens Our Democracy with Unrestricted Speech.\" Rating: False About this rating On Oct. 26, 2022, the Twitter account @ThePacificNews tweeted a screenshot of what to some users looked to be a news headline for a real and serious article. The headline read, \" Musk's Twitter Takeover Threatens Our Democracy with Unrestricted Speech.\" However, the truth was that \"The Pacific\" appeared to be little more than a parody account, as several other users noted . The bio for the account read, \"Journalism unbound by truth.\" Our \"Fake\" label indicates that this was not a serious news headline from a real website. The tweet was posted just before Musk's deadline to close his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter and take it private, according to The Associated Press . Actor James Woods chose to reshare the screenshot from The Pacific's tweet and may have believed it was a real headline from a news website. Woods tweeted , apparently in snark, \"Yeah, because how could a democracy ever survive free speech?\" Woods later removed his tweet, but not before it received tens of thousands of combined retweets and likes. One of the top-voted replies to the original tweet also came from a user who appeared to believe the headline was published in a serious manner by a real news organization. \"That's called the First Amendment I think,\" the user tweeted . That response was liked more than 670 times. Another person responded to the tweet with, \"It's 2022. I have no idea what's satire and what's actual 'journalism. '\" Our former colleague Dan Evon , who now works for the News Literacy Project, also noted that the Twitter bio for The Pacific showed a link to where they were selling T-shirts, rather than a link to a news website.",

    "rating": "True",
    "article_text": "Claim: In April 2021, Mike Lindell said his forthcoming social network Frank would not allow users to take \"God's name in vain.\" Rating: True About this rating In April 2021, news reports claimed that MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell had made a somewhat ironic pronouncement about the limitations that would be placed on content in a new social network, called Frank, which he purported to be launching in the coming days. Lindell, an ally and continuing supporter of former U.S. President Donald Trump, was banned from Twitter in early 2021, after persistently promoting the baseless conspiracy theory that President Joe Biden's November 2020 election win resulted from systematic and widespread electoral fraud. He has described his own planned social media site as \"the voice of free speech\" and a haven for those who have been \"shamed, marginalized, and characterized for speaking forth truth.\" On April 14 and 15, several websites reported, with raised eyebrows, that Lindell had vowed users of Frank would not be allowed to swear or take \"God's name in vain\" — restrictions that are not present on major social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. Unlilad.co.uk wrote that: If you’re after a healthy serving of irony, look no further than Lindell, the rightwing conspiracy theorist who has developed a firm loyalty to former president Donald Trump, and fed into the false claims that Joe Biden stole the 2020 US election. Recently, he spoke about the launch of his new social media platform, Frank, as he shared some more information on his latest venture. Its aim is to unite Conservatives who don’t appreciate having to adhere to the terms of use on Twitter or Facebook; instead offering a place where people can speak freely and, well, frankly in an echo chamber to rival the likes of Parler and Gab. The only catch, however, is that Mike doesn’t want users sharing certain words and will ban anyone that does. In a recent video, the 59-year-old revealed the specific rules of his free speech safe space: ‘You don’t get to use the four swear words: the c-word, the n-word, the f-word, or God’s name in vain.’ The Washington Times and The Verge published articles which similarly highlighted the degree of irony in those restrictions, on a site that Lindell has championed as a bastion of free speech. Those reports were accurate. In a video that appears to have been posted on April 14, Lindell gave a general, and at times rambling, description of Frank, saying users would get a preview of it on April 16, 2021, but it would be formally launched on the morning of April 19, 2021. Lindell said Frank would be \"like a YouTube/Twitter combination, you've never seen anything like it,\" and added: You're going to love it. You're going to have your own, like, YouTube channel, only that's your Twitter handle, or \"Twitter channel\" so to speak... You're not going to have to worry about what you're saying, and what's going — and worry about being able to speak out freely. And I do want to say one thing. That when you get in there on Thursday [April 16], when you get in there, look at our — I want you to look at our mission statement. Because we went back and defined — we found from our founding fathers and the Supreme Court and stuff, what defines free speech. So you're not going to have to worry about people, that they're on there, there's going to be a good reporting system. But you don't get to use the four swear words, you know the C word, the N word, the F word, or God's name in vain . You can't — free speech is not pornography, free speech isn't \"I'm going to kill you.\" It's very well defined in our mission statement. [Emphasis is added]. Major platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, which Lindell and others have criticized as policing speech, do not have an outright ban on the words to which Lindell alluded, but do prohibit hate speech and harassment. Those social networks do not prohibit content that could be interpreted as blasphemous, such as taking \"God's name in vain,\" as Lindell described. However, both Facebook and Twitter have, controversially, cooperated with government officials in cracking down on blasphemy in specific countries where it is outlawed.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Tom Anderson, co-founder of Myspace, vanished after selling his social media company to News Corp. for $580 million. Rating: False About this rating In late May 2024, the X account @DivineManhood published a thread of posts and videos detailing the story of Tom Anderson and his alleged disappearance from public life following the sale of the social media company he co-founded, Myspace . The initial tweet in the series amassed more than 25 million views, as of this writing. It said: \"This is Tom Anderson. At 35 years old, he sold Myspace for $580M. Then he bizarrely vanished. Here's his story.\" The posts then went into detail about Anderson's retirement from corporate life in the U.S. and his apparently \"completely silent\" life following his retirement. However, the claim that Anderson disappeared following his time at the helm of Myspace was false. Anderson co-founded the popular social networking site in 2003 along with Chris DeWolfe, and before long, it became the world's leading social media platform. Myspace automatically made Anderson new users' \"first friend,\" with his photo appearing in a person's top eight friends on the platform, where he was known as \"Tom from Myspace,\" \"Myspace Tom\" or \"My friend, Tom.\" In 2005, two years after launching the site, Anderson and DeWolfe sold Myspace to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. for $580 million. Afterward, Anderson continued working as the company's president. He retired from active involvement with Myspace in 2009 or 2010 as its popularity waned and Facebook usurped it as the most popular social networking site. Rather than starting another high-profile business venture, Anderson seemed to drop off the face of the earth. After leaving Myspace, he immersed himself in world travel and photography, capturing photographs of landscapes and exotic destinations like Thailand, Bhutan and the Maldives. Architectural Digest interviewed Anderson in 2017, where he discussed his passion for travel photography, a hobby he said he discovered while attending Burning Man in 2011. \"I took photos at the event and couldn't believe that was coming from my own camera. I was hooked instantly,\" he said. \"I like to photograph amazing scenes in nature — jaw dropping moments that are hard to believe they are even real.\" While he has accounts across multiple social media platforms — where his profile pictures are the same low-resolution photo he used on his Myspace profile beginning in 2003 — Anderson is not an active poster and will often go years between updates. His last Facebook post was in 2020, and before that he was active in June 2017, telling his followers he had been living in Oahu, Hawaii, part-time since retiring. A link to his personal website, myspacetom.com, led to an inactive URL. Anderson has a significant following on Instagram, where he shares his adventures and artistic work with his 668,000 followers under the handle @myspacetom. His bio reads: \"Former 1st friend! Will bring love to all. Inspired to connect. Hobbies: golf, surf, interior design, writing, creativity. Life Extension-Don't die!\" On April 26, 2024, Anderson posted a video to Instagram he filmed while golfing with friends, with the caption, \"A day with the boys, fit by @studentsgolf (yes, you can actually get those pants for yourself!)— I shot the video using the Meta Ray-Ban glasses, pretty easy!\" On X, his last post was a reply to the company's owner Elon Musk on March 1, 2024, while in June 2021 he shared with the world that he was \"excited to be a SpaceX investor.\" According to a 2017 Business Insider article, Anderson had been splitting his time between his three homes in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Hawaii, while in 2019, the Los Angeles Times reported that he purchased the former West Hollywood home of Drew Taggart of The Chainsmokers for $3.8 million. Although Anderson, now 53, maintains a low profile and no longer leads a major social media corporation, he did not disappear after selling Myspace for $580 million. Rather, it appears he simply chose to live life less in the public eye. Snopes has previously written about unusual disappearances, including the disappearance of Australian pilot Frederick Paul Valentich , and the strange disappearance of \"Tiger King\" star Carole Baskin's husband, Don Lewis .",

    "article_text": "Claim: A female NASA astronaut sabotaged the International Space Station Rating: Unproven About this rating In 2018, the question of whether a hole had been intentionally drilled into the Russian spacecraft Soyuz MS-09 by a saboteur sparked an investigation led by the Russian space agency, Roscosmos. Iterations of the claim appeared on X and a Reddit post on the subthread Theory/”Conspiracy”?in August 2023 that claimed the astronaut “was jealous and paranoid about what her boyfriend was doing back on Earth so she sabotage[d] the entire space station” (archived here ). NASA female astronaut sabotages the space station because she wanted to go home after 2 weeks of space. by u/xhealer2all in LengfOrGirf But did that really happen? It depends on whom you ask. Russian media repeated an unfounded rumor that Serena Auñón-Chancellor, a female NASA astronaut, had intentionally drilled a hole in the Russian spacecraft. NASA has publicly disputed the rumor. Let’s launch into the origins of this gossip. The Soyuz MS-09 is a Russian rocket that was launched from Kazakhstan on June 6, 2018. Three crew members – NASA's Auñón-Chancellor, Russian cosmonaut Sergey Prokopyev, and European Space Agency astronaut Alexander Gerst – were transported by the spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS) in June as part of a six-month mission that would end on Dec. 20, 2018. On Aug. 29, 2018, mission ground control in both Houston and Moscow detected signs of a “minute pressure leak” that resulted in a “small loss of cabin pressure,” according to updates made to the International Space Station Status blog beginning Aug. 30, 2018 (archived here ). The day following the leak, six crew members determined that there was a two-millimeter hole in the orbital compartment, or upper section, of the Soyuz MS-09 spacecraft attached to the Rassvet module of the Russian segment. This is a section of the Soyuz that does not return to Earth. Mission Control in Houston and the Russian Mission Control Center outside Moscow worked with the on-board crew to repair using “epoxy on a gauze wipe to plug the hole.” The crew was never thought to be in danger and after repairing, continued their six-month mission. (The hole is shown on the left before it was repaired, as is seen in the photo on the right. NASA) Some Russian media outlets reported the supposedly anonymous allegation that the hole may have been deliberately drilled by a crew member in space. According to an article published by the Russian news agency TASS, then-Roscosmos Space Chief Dmitry Rogozin had said: We are considering all the theories. The one about a meteorite impact has been rejected because the spaceship’s hull was evidently impacted from inside. However it is too early to say definitely what happened. But, it seems to be done by a faltering hand… it is a technological error by a specialist. It was done by a human hand - there are traces of a drill sliding along the surface. We don’t reject any theories. It is a matter of honor for Energia Rocket and Space Corporation to find the one responsible for that, to find out whether it was an accidental defect or a deliberate spoilage and where it was done - either on Earth or in space. Now it is essential to see the reason, to learn the name of the one responsible for that. And we will find out, without fail. NASA and Roscosmos issued a joint statement on Sept. 13, 2018, announcing the Russian space agency’s plan to “establish a Roscosmos-led Commission to investigate the cause of the leak” and acknowledging speculation “circulating in the media regarding the possible cause of the incident.” In 2021, Russian media outlet RIA Novosti reported that the investigation had been completed and the results sent to law enforcement officials for the next steps. “Earlier, reports appeared in the Russian media that the hole in the Soyuz was allegedly drilled by American astronaut Serina Auñon-Chancellor due to suffering after a failed romantic relationship with one of the crew members,” wrote the RIA Novosti. TASS also wrote in August 2021 that the hole could not have been made while the spacecraft was Earth-bound but rather was drilled by a person while in space. No further details were provided, and as of this publication, it is not apparent that any follow-up actions have been taken. At the time, NASA again disputed the allegations. \"NASA astronauts, including Serena Auñón-Chancellor, are extremely well-respected, serve their country, and make invaluable contributions to the agency,\" said NASA Associate Administrator for Space Operations Kathy Leuders wrote in a post shared to X on Aug. 13, 2021. \"We stand behind Serena and her professional conduct. We do not believe there is any credibility to these accusations.\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson echoed Leuders’ sentiment in a post shared to X on Aug. 13, 2021, writing, ”I whole heartedly agree with Kathy’s statement. I fully support Serena and I will always stand behind our astronauts.” I whole heartedly agree with Kathy’s statement. I fully support Serena and I will always stand behind our astronauts. https://t.co/gBvgFTP5vF — Bill Nelson (@SenBillNelson) August 13, 2021 “All the International Space Station partners are dedicated to mission safety and the welfare of the crew. The International Space Station partners all participate in multiple reviews prior to every major station activity to assess and ensure the safety of all crew members,” wrote Brian Odom , NASA chief historian, in an email to Snopes, adding: The hole that was detected in late August 2018 by the space station crew was quickly sealed, restoring air-tight pressure to the station. Russian cosmonauts conducted a spacewalk that December to gather additional engineering data for Russian specialists on Earth and to look externally at the effectiveness of the internal repair. The Soyuz spacecraft was thoroughly checked and deemed safe for the crew to return to Earth, which it did, on Dec. 20, 2018. Our NASA crew members perform their missions with professionalism and integrity. As of January 2024, it is still not apparent who or what did cause the hole, though many experts agree that it was likely due to a manufacturing defect.",

    "article_text": "Claim: In the late 90s, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) banned Furbys on its premises over fears they could record and repeat top-secret information. Rating: Research In Progress About this rating Context Multiple news outlets reported on the supposed ban, citing an internal NSA memo. Snopes reached out to the agency, as well as the U.S. Department of Defense and Hasbro (the toy's manufacturer), seeking a copy of that document for independent verification. We will update this report when, or if, we receive responses. When it first hit toy stores in 1998, Furby was an immediate sensation. The animatronic furball would eventually be recognized by Time Magazine as one of “ History’s Best Toys .” And just as it spiked in popularity among children looking for a new robotic friend, security officials were reportedly concerned over the robot’s potential to record top-secret information. Since 1999, claims online have circulated about the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) supposedly banning Furbys from its premises over fears the toy could be used as a spying tool. Media outlets across the world — including the BBC , The Guardian , CNN , CBS News , and The Independent , among others — reported on the supposed ban. All such stories stemmed from reporting by The Washington Post. On Jan. 13, 1999, The Post published an article titled “ A Toy Story of Hairy Espionage ” that read, in part: As harried parents scrambled in the weeks before Christmas to get their hands on these homely, high-tech cyberpets that supposedly repeat what they hear, the supersecret spy agency put out a \"Furby Alert\" on its internal intranet in early December and banned the Furby from Fort Meade. \"Personally owned photographic, video and audio recording equipment are prohibited items. This includes toys, such as Furbys,' with built-in recorders that repeat the audio with synthesized sound to mimic the original signal,\" the Furby Alert warned NSA workers. \"We are prohibited from introducing these items into NSA spaces. Those who have should contact their Staff Security Officer for guidance. [...] NSA officials were worried, said one Capitol Hill source monitoring the intelligence community, \"that people would take them home and they'd start talking classified.\" Snopes did not find a record of the aforementioned NSA internal memo, evidence that would allow us to independently verify the claim. We reached out to the U.S. Department of Defense, NSA, and Hasbro (the toy's manufacturer) requesting a copy of the document and for more information on the alleged ban. As we wait for responses, we’ve rated this claim a “Research in Progress.” When people first brought Furbys home, the fur-covered robotic pets would initially speak and sing in “ Furbish ,\" an entirely made-up language. But, with time, the toys would eventually speak English. It was that purported learning capability that prompted the alleged ban on Furbys across NSA properties. Officials supposedly believed the robots were potentially embedded with devices that could record and repeat sensitive information. As of this writing, Furby has an entry in the Computer History Museum ’s artifact collection that reads (emphasis ours): This furry toy ignited a 1998 holiday season buying frenzy, with resale prices reaching $300. Each Furby initially spoke only “Furbish” but could gradually learn English commands. It communicated with other nearby Furbies using an infrared port between its eyes. However, technically speaking, Furby was not actually \"learning\" new information, according to the toy's patent. Instead, the toy was pre-programmed with an English vocabulary that, over time, would be unveiled to owners as they played with them. Roger Shiffman — who was the owner of Tiger Electronics, a subsidiary of Hasbro, at the time — reportedly refuted NSA allegations that the toy could record or repeat classified information. At the time, CBS News reported Shiffman said, “Furby has absolutely no ability to do any recording whatsoever” and didn’t “learn” anything — the toys just repeated already-programmed information. Furthermore, a May 1999 research article published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists cited a Jan. 21, 1999, Hasbro press release that supposedly attributed the below quote to Shiffman: … although Furby is a clever toy, it does not record or mimic voices. Each Furby is preprogrammed to react to its environment. The NSA did not do their homework. Furby is not a spy! (Snopes was unable to locate that purported press release online for its viewing, though asked Hasbro about it.) Additionally, to confirm whether Furby was able to record audio it supposedly hears, Snopes tracked down the toy’s U.S. patent . It described infrared transmitters and receivers, like those found in television remote controls, to react to external stimuli. Sensors allowed the toy to move and respond to stimuli, as well as interact with other Furbys, while a single motor allowed for the toy's movements. The patent read, in part: The toy utilizes sensors for detecting sensory inputs which dictate the movements of the body parts in response to the sensed inputs. The sensors also allow several of the toys to interact with each other. The body parts are driven for movement by a single motor which is relatively small in terms of its power requirements given the large number of different movements that it powers. Snopes found no mention of recording devices contained within the toy. (US Patents) According to a 2019 article published by the technology outlet, IEEE Spectrum , Furby’s source code was written by computer engineers David Hampton and Wayne Schulz to run on a variation of the 6502 microprocessor — the 8-bit chip that powered the Apple II, Commodore 64 and BBC Micro. According to a post written by Terry Kraus, a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) historian, Furby was also temporarily banned on all aircraft in the late 90s over concerns that its technology could disrupt equipment. At the time, the FAA denied the rumor, saying it recommended the toy be stowed and used like other small electronic devices on flights. There have also been rumors of Navy officials prohibiting the toy at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine. In 2024, you can purchase a Furby for $69.99",

    "article_text": "Claim: Nathan Gilroy, who graduated from MIT, invented Powersave, an energy-saving device meant to reduce household electricity bills. Rating: False About this rating When a product takes on more than one name and has an elusive backstory, it raises some questions. And we faced a big question mark surrounding the identity of Nathan Gilroy, a personality who had been widely touted on Facebook as an \"inventor,\" but had no real credentials available to back him up, nor much of an online presence to begin with. Ads for the so-called \"Powersave\" device had been circulating on Facebook in late 2020, describing how a young \"genius\" named Nathan Gilroy had invented an energy-saving device that would reduce electricity costs in homes by 50%. A video shows a young teen, purportedly an 18-year-old Gilroy, who allegedly grew up in \"the poorest neighborhood of St. Louis.\" The video claims his device is helping poor families across America who are struggling with electricity bills. Elsewhere, a number of websites shared \"facts\" about him, claiming that Gilroy graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) at a young age. There were a number of red flags in the meager information available about Gilroy. Firstly, throughout the video, the young teen does not speak. All the information is conveyed through text overlaid on video, and what appear to be spliced together images and clips that could have been pulled from a range of sources. Even the people offering testimonials about the product are simply talking, voiceless heads on the screen with overlaid text purportedly quoting them. But to determine whether Gilroy the inventor was a real person behind this device, we reached out to MIT. A representative from its media relations team pointed out that university officials \"typically don't definitively confirm that a person did not attend MIT, as there can be situations where someone enrolled under a different name or participated in a special program.\" They did, however, check with the MIT Registrar's Office in this case, and found there was no record of an individual with the name Nathan Gilroy having been an enrolled MIT student. There is very little else about him available online. Given that key parts of Gilroy's identity and credentials are impossible to confirm, his educational background is outright falsified, and the promotional material around him appears deliberately deceptive, we have concluded that such a person does not exist. In August 2023, a number of Facebook videos emerged, promoting the device again, but this time the so-called inventor was a man named \"Noah Watson\" and his device was called \"BoldHero.\" The videos had repurposed the same old clips showed the young man speaking and appearing to give an interview, but we still cannot hear him. This time, his backstory claimed he grew up poor in Jacksonville, Florida, and was raised by a single mother before he went to Harvard. Ultimately the videos seek to promote the same device under a different story and name. But is the device just a scam? Described as a \"smart device plugged into socket,\" and a \"voltage stabilizer,\" it apparently conserves electricity, but no details are offered about the device's mechanisms that allow it to do this. It also goes by different names online. One website called it ElectroPro while others called it \" Power saver. \" Amazon shared a version of the device labelled \" Powersave .\" Facebook videos from August 2023 called it \"BoldHero\" and the device was also available on Amazon under that name, as of this writing. Most Amazon reviews say the device is useless, or a \"total scam.\" Scamadvisor , a popular YouTube channel, called it a \"complete waste of money\" and said the product they ordered looked completely different from how it was advertised. But the only way to test if the device really works and will save money on electricity bills is to order it oneself. Given that the purported inventor of this device does not appear to exist, we don't recommend that our readers try. We therefore rate this claim as \"False.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: In mid-March 2021, Netflix sent out a test warning to an undisclosed number of users as a reminder that account holders should not be sharing passwords with others if they don’t live in the same house. Rating: True About this rating In mid-March 2021, some Netflix account holders received a test warning message that reminded users not to share their accounts with those who live outside of their home. And the internet was not happy. The rollout of the Netflix test message was first reported on March 10 by technology data research publication GammaWire . “If you don’t live with the owner of this account, you need your own account to keep watching,” the warning read. According to photos shared to social media, users were given the option to verify their account by email or text message, or to “verify later.” If they weren’t able to verify their account, they were also offered the opportunity to sign up for a 30-day free trial. In an email to Snopes, Netflix confirmed that the test message was sent out to the profiles of some users, but did not disclose how many accounts were impacted. “This test is designed to help ensure that people using Netflix accounts are authorized to do so,” wrote a spokesperson for the streaming platform. According to the market and consumer data company Statista , Netflix had over 203 million global users — with the U.S. accounting for over 73 million accounts — at the end of 2020. But the streaming giant did not respond to our follow-up questions to determine whether the test was rolled out only to accounts in the U.S. and whether it was meant to signify a more permanent change to the platform. It is unclear whether a service-wide rollout will eventually restrict account holders from sharing passwords to those who live outside of their homes. If we hear back regarding those questions, we will update this post.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A new Facebook rule starts tomorrow that allows the company to use your photos in court and also makes all of your posts and deleted messages public. Rating: False About this rating Fact Check \"Don't forget tomorrow starts the new Facebook rule where they can use your photos.\" This was the way a virally shared post was copied and pasted in June 2022, and in the months before. It claimed that the deadline for this supposed rule change was \"today\" and that the photographs could \"be used in court cases in litigation.\" The post added that, \"Everything you've ever posted [on Facebook] becomes public from today - even messages that have been deleted.\" Despite these claims, the good news for Facebook users was that none of this was true. Facebook users have copied and pasted dubious and partly or wholly false statements for many years. What makes this one different is that it's been making rounds, in one form or another, for at least a decade. Here's how this variation of the copypasta was shared on Facebook: Don't forget tomorrow starts the new Facebook rule where they can use your photos. Don't forget the Deadline is today!!! It can be used in court cases in litigation against you. Everything you've ever posted becomes public from today - even messages that have been deleted. So post the following to your page. Copy and paste it to your page now! I DO NOT GIVE FACEBOOK PERMISSION TO SHARE ANYTHING OF MINE., THAT I HAVE PUT ON THEIR SITE, . PICTURES, CURRENT OR PAST POSTS, PHONE NUMBERS OR EMAILS.. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING CAN BE USED IN ANY FORM WITHOUT MY WRITTEN PERMISSION OR VERBAL CONSENT. Some variations of posts that we found in June 2022 also contained references to \"Channel 13 News,\" a \"UCC\" code, \"the Rome Statute,\" and the \"POPI Act.\" None of these additions to the copypasta made the shares any less dubious. We previously reported on two other similar variations of this same post. One prior version of the copypasta, which we covered in November 2021, began like this: \"The new Facebook/ Meta rule starts tomorrow where they can use your photos. Don't forget the deadline is today! This could be used in lawsuits against you. Everything you've ever posted is posted today – even messages that have been deleted. It doesn't cost anything, just copy and post, better than regretting later.\" Several other variations of the same post have a history that can be traced all the way back to at least 2012. One began as follows: \"Hi all. Don't forget today starts the new Instagram rule where they can use your photo Don't forget Deadline tomorrow !!! Everything you've ever posted becomes public from tomorrow. Even messages that have been deleted or the photos not allowed. It costs nothing for a simple copy and paste, better safe than sorry.\" As we previously reported, users of Facebook or any other platform owned by Meta cannot make any changes to their rights under the company's policies simply by posting a statement on their profile. This includes posting messages in nothing but capital letters. See Meta/Facebook's terms of service for the company's policies governing users' data and media. In sum, no, a \"new Facebook rule\" does not start \"tomorrow\" such that Meta \"can use your photos,\" nor are all users' private posts and deleted messages being made public.",

    "article_text": "Claim: WhatsApp users with smartphones using older operating systems will need to update by Nov. 1, 2021, to keep using the chat app. Rating: True About this rating In late October 2021, multiple news outlets published stories cautioning that WhatsApp users with older smartphones won't be able to use the popular chat app after Nov. 1, 2021. For example, the British viral news site Unilad reported , \"WhatsApp Will Be Blocked On Millions Of Phones Next Week.\" It's true that as of Nov. 1, 2021, many older devices with old operating systems will no longer support WhatsApp. According to WhatsApp's website , the devices that support the app are: Android running OS 4.1 and newer iPhone running iOS 10 and newer KaiOS 2.5.0 and newer, including JioPhone and JioPhone 2 That means if you own a device with an operating system older than the ones listed above, you won't be able to use WhatsApp on that device after Nov. 1, 2021. WhatsApp stated that users with the older devices will need to \"switch to a supported device,\" or save your chat history before that date. A spokesperson for Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, told Snopes by email that the tech giant regularly reviews aging hardware and software and \"will periodically withdraw ongoing support for the very oldest systems with the fewest users,\" and that it's standard for tech companies to do so for old devices and software with a dwindling user base. The spokesperson said that the number of users affected was not in the \"millions\" but said he couldn't provide a figure for the number of people affected. WhatsApp is a chat app widely used internationally, with an estimated user base upwards of 2 billion .",

    "article_text": "Claim: Ovia, an app for tracking reproductive health, requires users to input their country and state. Rating: True About this rating Context Ovia has three apps available for download on smartphones: a fertility and period tracker, a pregnancy and baby tracker and an infant care tracker. All three require users to input their country and state before accessing the app’s services. In mid-2024, social media users began spreading a claim that Ovia, an app used to track reproductive health, requires users to provide their country and state of residence before accessing the app's tracking services. The claim found its way onto platforms like Facebook , X and Reddit . Some of the posts specify a certain Ovia app — there are three different apps under the Ovia brand — like this September Reddit post with 14,000 upvotes, which refers to Ovia's ovulation tracking app: My ovulation tracker suddenly asked what state I live in by u/BabserellaWT in WitchesVsPatriarchy Whereas this August post refers to Ovia's pregnancy tracking app: Ovia app required my country/state by u/Infinite_abyss in BabyBumps Other posts don't specify which Ovia app requires users to provide their location, like this X post from December: (X user @NineInchClawz) The claims made in these posts are true. Snopes downloaded all three Ovia apps — one for fertility, ovulation and menstruation, one for pregnancy and one for infant care — and could not get past the basic information page to access the rest of the app without filling out the \"country of residence\" and \"state of residence\" queries. The state of residence query appears as a required field if the user chooses the United States as the country of residence. Snopes reached out to Ovia and we will update this story if we hear back. Here's a screenshot from Ovia's fertility and menstruation tracker showing that country of residence and state of residence are required fields in order to proceed further: Screenshot of an Ovia app. (Ovia: Fertility, Cycle, Health) Ovia Health — which produces the three Ovia apps — makes it clear in its privacy policy that the company collects geolocation data from users, which includes \"approximate location by country, state, city, zipcode and regional area.\" Ovia's apps also tell users that it collects state and country information to ensure it follows your locality's privacy laws and to \"further protect your data,\" referencing the fact that many states are introducing or considering new privacy laws to protect people's personal data. But many users expressed concern that the app would provide its geolocation data if subpoenaed in court, potentially providing evidence to help convict people who miscarry or seek an abortion in states that outlawed abortion after the fall of federal abortion rights under Roe v. Wade. One Facebook post from Dec. 12 warning others about Ovia said, \"I do indeed think it's worth considering the risk to women these days to track fertility by state.\" That's a real concern shared by privacy experts and reported by reputable news outlets, including NPR . As of July, there haven't been any cases where a menstrual tracking app's data has been subpoenaed, according to reporting from Stateline , a publication focused on nationwide trends in state legislatures. But \"that's probably due to the slow speed of which cases proceed through the court system,\" the report noted. As of Dec. 12, we found no news outlets reporting on any menstrual tracking app data being subpoenaed — and if it happened, it would likely be newsworthy. Jake Laperruque, deputy director of The Center For Democracy and Technology's Security and Surveillance Project, said the organization is \"unaware of any publicly reported instances to date in which period tracker data has been subpoenaed.\" However, Laperruque noted it's possible there are instances that haven't received public attention or that can't be disclosed publicly because of a nondisclosure order.",

And yes, they fart. What's False Although the robot has a tail, it's a bit of a stretch to refer to it as a cat. What's Undetermined It's unknown whether Panasonic will produce more robots for the general public to purchase. In mid-February 2021, Panasonic Japan released a video of a little round robot created for the sole purpose of human companionship. The robot's name is Nicobo. It has a child's voice, digital eyes, a tail, and yes, it farts. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OuzDxXToHg&feature=youtu.be Although we can confirm that Panasonic did create the robot, we can't say Nicobo will be available for purchase to the general public. We also can't say that the robot is a cat, per se. Although it has a tail, it is, as Gizmodo describes it, \"as if someone flipped a bowl over, gave it some animated eyes, a wagging tail, and then wrapped it in an old sock.\" Nicobo has a limited vocabulary that expands over time, with limitations. It speaks in Katakoto, the Japanese term for baby talk, so it's never going to carry on a philosophical conversation with you. But as Gizmodo reported, \"its crude mutterings will help reinforce the feeling that it’s genuinely attentive and listening to your feelings, even if it can’t do anything about them. Sometimes that’s all a human needs.\" Panasonic is crowdfunding for the production of a limited number of the companion robots, and as of this writing, has exceeded its goal of 10 million yen (just over $95,000 U.S. dollars). Its crowdfunding site says the units will be delivered to prospective buyers by March 2022.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Paris Hilton was seen wearing an \"anti-paparazzi\" scarf that ruins pictures taken with flash photography. Rating: Outdated About this rating In December 2022, pictures of Paris Hilton wrapped in a red-patterned scarf were posted online, along with commentary that the hotel chain heiress and famed socialite was wearing an \"anti-paparazzi\" scarf. It appears that Hilton was indeed wearing an article of clothing touted as being designed with anti-flash (as in camera flash) technology, but as of this writing, the photograph is more than 7 years old. The first instances in which we saw the photograph of Hilton in the red scarf was in June 2016. An article published by the business publication Insider reported in 2016 that the scarf is made of a material that reflects light. Designed by Saif Siddiqui, who runs the brand ISHU, the scarf is indeed intended to provide privacy. On the brand's website, the scarves, which sell for $276 and come in black and red patterns, are advertised as being uniquely able to black out unwanted photographs and videos. Technology news site TechCrunch in 2016 published an explainer on how such clothing works — it basically tricks the camera into thinking that the scene being photographed is brighter than it really is, causing the device to reduce the amount of light emitted by the camera flash. The result? Likely a ruined picture, with an overly bright scarf and everything else in the dark.",

    "article_text": "Claim: In some instances, sending money via Twitter’s new \"Tip Jar\" feature would reveal to the recipient the sender’s PayPal-affiliated, snail-mail address. Rating: True About this rating Context When using PayPal to send money on Twitter, a customer can select one of two options on how that money is sent before processing the payment: One that will automatically share the customer’s snail-mail address with the recipient, and a second that will not. This former option can be disabled by toggling a specific option in the user’s account. In May 2021, Twitter announced a new feature that allowed users to “tip” their favorite profiles. But as news of the money-sharing option was rolled out to the public, a “glaring privacy issue\" was flagged by some users: Sending money over PayPal could unintentionally share their snail-mail (physical) address with the recipient. Twitter announced the new feature on May 6, and at the time of this writing, it was in the testing phase, only available to a select number of journalists and organizations. Tip Jar is slated to be available via a mobile app on Android and iOS, and will use third-party services like Venmo, Cash App, Bandcamp, Patreon, and PayPal to send “tips” to select people. The option is relatively easy to use. A person need simply to click on the dollar bill icon next to a username, and Twitter redirects the user to a monetary platform to complete the transaction. “We $ee you – sharing your PayPal link after your Tweet goes viral, adding your $Cashtag to your profile so people can support your work, dropping your Venmo handle on your birthday, or if you just need some extra help,” announced the platform in a blog post. But as many media outlets pointed out, if a person sends money using PayPal, in some instances, the snail-mail address associated with the account will also be sent over. The issue was first pointed out by security researcher Rachel Tobac, who shared in a May 6 tweet that in some instances, the Tip Jar option could reveal a user’s home address — or any that is affiliated with the PayPal account — to the person receiving money. In subsequent comments, Tobac said that she had done a test with another user, noting that while it is a “hallmark” of PayPal, the nuance could still impact Twitter users who do not know that their address is affiliated with their PayPal account. In response to Tobac’s tweet, Twitter Product Lead Kayvon Beykpour said that the social media platform cannot control PayPal practices, but that the social media platform planned to add a warning for people who donate money via the service. In an email to Snopes, PayPal spokesperson Tom Hunter described how the payment flow works on PayPal. “When using PayPal to send and receive money, there are two options a customer can select before processing the payment on how that money is sent. ‘Goods and Services' is used to buy or pay for an item or service from someone and will automatically share the customer’s address with the recipient for the delivery of those goods and services,” explained Hunter. “Customers can toggle within the payment flow to select ‘Friends and Family,’ which does not share the address with the recipient. This is the standard functionality of the PayPal app and we will work with Twitter closely to ensure user awareness.” Click here for more information on changing your PayPal account preferences.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A cellular service outage on June 15, 2020, enabled Apple and Google to covertly install COVID-19 tracking apps onto phones. Rating: Mostly False About this rating What's True In May 2020, Apple and Google launched a COVID-19 exposure notifications technology, which allows users to choose whether they want to use COVID-19 tracing apps on their phones. On June 15, 2020, many T-Mobile customers experienced network outages. What's False However, the phone outage (which was mostly limited to one network) and the availability of COVID-19 tracking technology occurred at different times. Furthermore, Google and Apple's exposure notification technology is not functional without the user's consent. What's Undetermined Privacy advocates are still weighing the pros and cons of proximity-tracing apps that use Google and Apple's technology. A phone network outage coinciding with the coronavirus pandemic in the summer of 2020 became fertile ground for rumors in mid-June, when some cellphone users in the U.S. claimed they couldn’t send or receive calls and text messages. Soon after, Facebook posts claimed that the network outage enabled a suspiciously timed \"COVID-19 Tracker\" to be added to Apple and Android phones. Snopes readers sent us numerous posts with variations on the above rumor, but the reality was far less dramatic. We learned that the June network outage primarily occurred with T-Mobile customers, and the COVID-19 exposure notifications technology in iPhones and Androids had been rolled out much earlier . Also, that tracker technology cannot be activated unless users choose to turn it on. Here's what we know: On June 15, 2020 , T-Mobile and its subsidiary Sprint, along with some Verizon and AT&T users, reported service outages. AT&T and Verizon reported their networks were operating normally — Verizon, for instance, said the problems stemmed from \"another carrier's\" network issues, which meant that their users' calls to and from T-Mobile accounts were failing. Meanwhile, T-Mobile announced a circuit failure on its end was the root cause for the outage. The rumor in the meme displayed below began circulating a few days later connecting the outage to the COVID tracking: But the new tracker feature already appeared to be available, though not entirely functional, in cellphones, weeks before the outage. An Android user, for instance, shared a screenshot of what appeared to be an added feature in Google settings on May 12, presumably an early version of these so-called \"trackers\": A verified Google employee responded to the query on the same forum: The exposure notifications is an application programming interface (API), not a phone application, that offers app developers a number of standardized operations they can use. Developers working for public health agencies around the world issue applications using this API created by Apple and Google. The Google employee emphasized that if the user opted not to download any application that used that notification, then the notification would not be turned on and would not be able to collect any data. If Android users click on the COVID-19 notifications feature, which is available through Google settings, they have to both install a participating app from their region to activate the exposure notifications and enable Bluetooth to use the feature. On May 20 , Google and Apple announced the official rollout of the exposure notification API, which uses Bluetooth technology to help governments reduce the spread of COVID-19. Apple and Google barred authorities from using their technology to collect GPS data or require users to enter personal data. The companies are relying on encrypted Bluetooth metadata to identify person-to-person transmission of the disease. Snopes covered how Bluetooth technology traced COVID-19 transmissions here . We reached out to both Apple and Google about the rumor. A representative for Apple did not address our question about the alleged link between the outage and tracker but instead provided a general statement regarding privacy. In that statement, the rep confirmed to Snopes that users must explicitly choose to turn on the exposure notifications system for it to work, and it does not collect or use their device location. Identities are also protected from Google, Apple, and other users. Users can choose to report a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, and any data collected is only for COVID-19 response efforts. Details about how Google and Apple say they will protect privacy can be found here and here . A Google representative, however, did confirm \"no connection\" exists between the June 15 mobile phone network outage and the exposure notifications roll-out. We should note that privacy advocates from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) are wary of Google and Apple’s approach to tracking COVID-19 transmission, and have highlighted a number of security risks, while acknowledging that \"Bluetooth proximity is the most promising approach so far to automated COVID tracking.\" In sum, because only one major telecommunications network faced widespread disruptions in June, while the exposure notifications application was rolled out in May, the timing makes the overarching claim that the rollout and the outage are related impossible. In addition, cellphone users must themselves download an app, meaning it can't be sneakily added on phones. That said, although Google and Apple have said they have put many privacy safeguards in place, critics still question whether those safeguards are adequate. Given all of the above, we rate this claim as “Mostly False.”",

Rating: False About this rating On March 26, 2023, a number of photographs of Twitter and Tesla CEO Elon Musk went viral, claiming to show him holding hands with different women, including Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The first photograph from @blovereviews appeared to show Musk holding hands with Barra. A few hours later, the account shared another photograph claiming, \"Hours after being seen with Mary Barra, Elon Musk was spotted with AOC.\" Neither of these photographs was real but rather were digitally manipulated by an artificial intelligence (AI) program. There is no evidence that Musk was with either of these women. Barra and Ocasio-Cortez are both in committed relationships, and neither would realistically be seen walking around in public with Musk in that manner. The woman in the above tweet is definitely not Ocasio-Cortez — for a comparison, see a picture of Ocasio-Cortez here . Musk also tweeted a response to the photograph with Barra, stating, \"I would never wear that outfit.\" The creator of the images also admitted to the digital manipulation. Brian Lovett, a tech YouTuber, acknowledged that he used the AI program Midjourney and did not make the images \"completely photorealistic.\" He noted how many online honed in on the hands in the photographs and other elements that seemed off. But he said that he wanted to show \"where we are at with this technology[...] already at a crazy and somewhat alarming place.\" He even joked about getting a response from Musk on Twitter: It is getting harder to spot a \" deepfake ,\" which is an image or video created with the aid of artificial intelligence (AI). We put together a guide on how to spot them, here . Given that the creator of the photographs has himself admitted to manipulating images of Musk and the two women, and that there's no evidence that such interactions took place in real life, we rate this claim as \"False.\"",

However, several researchers have uncovered privacy issues with robot vacuums produced by several different manufacturers. In December 2022, MIT Technology Review published an article, titled, \"A Roomba recorded a woman on the toilet. How did screenshots end up on Facebook?\" The article explained exactly what its headline stated — that in 2020, photos taken by Roomba robot vacuums, some of which could be viewed as potentially compromising, made their way onto Facebook. A viral video posted to Facebook in May 2025 re-upped interest in the story, and Snopes readers searched the site wondering if it was true. It was. The story was published in a highly trusted magazine, cited several security experts, and included a comment from iRobot, the manufacturer of the Roomba, confirming that the images found online were taken on Roomba robots in 2020. Snopes reached out to iRobot for comment on the story. A spokesperson directed us to the MIT Technology Review article. According to a statement from iRobot in the article, the photos in question were not taken by commercially available Roombas, however. Instead, they were from \"s pecial development robots with hardware and software modifications that are not and never were present on iRobot consumer products for purchase\"; owned by \"paid collectors and employees,\" who the company said signed agreements acknowledging that the robots would be capturing photos and videos for training; and that featured a \"bright green sticker that read 'video recording in progress.'\" According to the story, the vacuums took pictures of their surroundings for the purpose of training artificial intelligence models. In order for a robot to understand what it's looking at, however, a human first needs to tell the robot what various objects are. iRobot outsourced that work to a company called ScaleAI, which contracts workers around the world to look at a photo and label what's in it, according to the article. That's how workers from Venezuela got their hands on the photos and how they made their way onto social media. MIT Technology Review wrote that iRobot did not allow them to see the consent forms, and the company did not allow reporters to speak with any of the employees or paid collectors. In a follow-up story, however, several individuals who tested the special robots told MIT Technology Review they felt misled by the consent agreement they signed and were concerned about how iRobot used their data. It is important to note that in this case, the robots were not commercially available, and whether or not iRobot breached its data privacy agreement, the robots were labeled as being able to take photo and video. IRobot's privacy policy contains the following section on how it uses data from Roombas: Some of our devices are equipped with \"smart technology\" that can wirelessly send us data. These devices include, but are not limited to: Roomba j series Roomba i series Roomba s series Certain Wi-Fi connected Roomba 600 series Braava jet m series aair Lite Small Room Air Purifier aair 3-in-1 Pro Air Purifier If you have one of these devices, we may collect information about your: device and app usage, like name, device number, battery life, mission information, device health and operations data, device replenishment like the need for new filters or other robot device parts, device environment like level of dirt, Wi-Fi name/credentials/signal strength, robot movement, floorplan and room names, existence and type of objects, floor type, other iRobot devices, partner app information (specifically the names of smart home partner apps you have downloaded. This data is stored in a deidentified state (separated from identifiable information). Unless your device is enrolled in the iRobot Select program, your device will NOT automatically transmit this information to iRobot. To be able to transmit, the device needs to be (1) registered online and (2) connected to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or the internet in some way. Apart from iRobot Select devices that require connections to operate, you can use our smart technology devices without Wi-Fi or Bluetooth data transmission, simply by disconnecting your Wi-Fi or Bluetooth from the device or by never connecting it at all. For more information on how to disconnect your device from Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, please see the section below \" 9. What are my choices regarding my information? \". But because most robot vacuums connect to Wi-Fi, have cameras (and some have speakers and/or microphones), there are several valid security concerns about robot vacuums — give experienced hackers enough time and they'll probably find a way to get into a system. In 2020, for instance, researchers at the University of Maryland were able to record audio using a \"laser-based navigation system\" that vacuum robots use to determine where objects are. More recently, Dennis Giese , an independent researcher who tears down and hacks robot vacuums in his spare time, helped the Australian Broadcasting Corporation hack into an Ecovacs Deebot X2 in 2024 — earlier that year, according to a separate ABC article , several Ecovacs robots were hacked in cities across America, and shouted racial slurs at their owners.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A picture shows a young boy holding a picture of himself with the caption, \"The boy drew this beautiful picture, at first he was very upset, he thought it was ugly.\" Rating: Fake About this rating A rumor circulating online throughout 2024 claimed a picture showed a young boy holding a picture he drew of himself in a meadow, in front of a stream. According to the caption users shared with the image, the boy believed his self-portrait was \"ugly.\" In an email sent to Snopes on Dec. 12, 2024, a reader requested we look into the authenticity of the image, writing, \"FB pic of boy holding 'his drawing' of himself. Questioning authenticity of art versus AI generated.\" A reverse-image search to locate shares of the picture found numerous posts , primarily on Facebook . For example, on Nov. 18, a Facebook page named I Love Pets posted , \" The boy drew this beautiful picture, at first he was very upset, he thought it was ugly.\" One Facebook user replied, about the image of the boy, \"So excellent and beautiful. You are a very gifted young man.\" Another person said, \"I think this picture is amazing. This young boy is very talented.\" A seemingly countless number of users submitted similar comments complimenting the boy's artistic talents. However, the image of the boy holding the self-portrait was fake, including both the boy and the artwork in his hands. The reader who emailed us correctly wondered if someone created the entire picture with an artificial intelligence (AI) tool. Our reverse-image search located another AI-generated picture showing a different-looking boy also holding a self-portrait, with the same caption. The posts' caption claimed the boy was upset and believed the portrait was ugly, using this as engagement bait to evoke emotions and prompt users to like, comment, and share the content. The Russian-language Facebook page named POFU - Good Humor possibly uploaded the first post (since deleted) of the AI-generated picture earlier in the year on Feb. 2. The caption read the same, except in Russian. We contacted the page's owners to ask if they created the image and will update this story if we receive a response. Signs of the Picture's AI Trickery One sure sign of the image's inauthenticity pertained to the cut-out nature of the bottom of the boy's self-portrait, which ended prematurely and did not form a straight line similar to the left, top and right sides of the frame. The plants in the room also strangely appeared in front of and behind the portrait, perhaps as a mistake in the AI tool's attempted generation of the nature scene in the boy's drawing and the separate component of the boy holding the artwork. Additionally, a very small and white artifact displayed on the boy's right ear. Red boxes highlight the signs someone generated the picture with an AI tool. Further, some users with a trained eye to spot signs of AI-generated pictures — meaning people who have viewed hundreds or thousands such images in the past — might immediately notice its overly-smooth appearance. We previously reported about other AI-generated images, including pictures of Mickey Mouse dropkicking a toddler at Disneyland, as well as quadruplet sisters posing behind a cake to celebrate their 90th birthday.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A comic first published in 1919 predicted cell phones. Rating: True About this rating A comic strip allegedly published in 1919 is often shared on social media due to the work's apparent prescience. The comic, records show, is genuine and stems from a March 5, 1919 edition of the British tabloid The Mirror. It was titled, \"The Pocket Telephone: When Will It Ring,\" and the answer to that question was, according to the illustration, essentially all the time: According to the British Cartoon Archive, the comic was created by W. K. Haselden and first published in The Mirror on March 5, 1919. It was subsequently republished on Jan., 23, 1923, with the caption, \"When we all have pocket telephones.\" For those reasons, we rated this claim \"True.\" The comic was seemingly a response to a claim by the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company — an early player in long-distance wireless communication — that it was not far off from the realization of a pocket-sized wireless phone, as described in a widely syndicated March 1919 wire report : London, March 2 — Experiments in a new type of wireless telephone are so far advanced that it is proposed within a few weeks it will be possible to speak between London and New York. While the establishment of a regular commercial service by wireless telephone between London and New York early next year is expected by the Marconi company, according to a statement by Godfrey C. Isaacs, managing director of the company, to a correspondent of the Daily Mail. An early realization of pocket wireless telephone is also foreshadowed by Mr. Isaacs, who says that experiments have led him to believe that the pocket wireless will be in everyday use at no distant date.

    "article_text": "Claim: Pokémon Go developer Niantic is working on a Harry Potter version of the hugely popular augmented-reality game. Rating: True About this rating Augmented reality game Pokémon Go was an instant hit after it was released in summer 2016. The fad led to rumor after rumor , including the potential for a Hogwarts-themed version of the game dubbed \"Harry Potter Go.\" What began as speculative memes and petitions developed into solid rumors that Niantic immediately decided to build upon its success by releasing a Harry Potter variant. Before long, the buzz transcended social media to reach news media, with reports that Harry Potter Go was set for a 2017 release. Some articles simply speculated , but outlets like Hello Giggles and NME reported in July 2016 that \"Harry Potter Go\" was definitely, well, a go: The creators of Pokémon Go are developing a Harry Potter version of the game. Niantic have announced that they will be making Harry Potter Go following the success of their Pokémon game. Since over 15 million users worldwide have downloaded Pokémon Go, fans of the J.K. Rowling books and films have been petitioning Warner Bros to create a Harry Potter game. Hello Giggles reports that Niantic's senior developer Marcus Figueroa said the company had decided to create the game as \"the demand for this title was absolutely insane, so we figured we'd give it a shot.\" The story seems to have first appeared on JTXHNews , which referenced an apparently nonexistent interview with gaming outlet IGN : Niantic’s senior developer Marcus Figueroa announced the new project in an interview with IGN We have acquired the rights for the app. The demand for this title was absolutely insane, so we figured we’d give it a shot. If we’re lucky we might see a launch by early 2017, but it’s hard to tell this early in the project. When pressed for details, Figueroa had this to say We want to do something with schools of witchcraft and wizardry, similar to pokestops in Pokemon GO. As wells a quest system, and possibly large scale completely interactive events, but no promises. That’s all I can say. JTHXNews appears visually identical to hoax purveyors that spread viral fabrications claiming that celebrities are moving to (or experiencing flat tires in) small towns across Canada and the United States. On the same day NME reported that Harry Potter Go was in development, Gizmodo pointed out that no record of a \"Marcus Figeroa\" at Niantic exists , and no such announcement appeared anywhere other than a fake news outlet. Niantic made no such announcement in July or August 2016, and did not indicate that any plans for \"Harry Potter Go\" were in even the earliest planning stages. However, that doesn't rule out a Harry Potter Go game eventually appearing, as Pokémon Go was first conceived as an April Fool's Day hoax in 2014. On 8 November 2017, the \"hoax\" became reality when Niantic announced that it would be releasing a Pokémon Go-type augmented reality game for Harry Potter enthusiasts. The game will be called \"Harry Potter: Wizards Unite\": We're incredibly excited to announce this next step in the evolution of AR mobile entertainment. With Harry Potter: Wizards Unite , players that have been dreaming of becoming real life Wizards will finally get the chance to experience J.K. Rowling’s Wizarding World. Players will learn spells, explore their real world neighborhoods and cities to discover & fight legendary beasts and team up with others to take down powerful enemies. We're thrilled to partner with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, and WB Games San Francisco’s development team to bring this magical and beloved series to life in a brand new way. Harry Potter: Wizards Unite will leverage the full stack of the Niantic Platform while also providing an opportunity to pioneer all new technology and gameplay mechanics. While details remain sketchy so far, we have updated the rating on this page from \"False\" to \"True\" to update the new (augmented) reality.",

    "article_text": "Claim: \"Pokémon GO\" developer Niantic used location-based player data to build an artificial intelligence navigation system. Rating: True About this rating Context According to a blog post on Niantic’s official website, it is only the optional \"Pokémon GO\" feature called \"Scan a PokéStop\" that contributes to the machine learning of its AI geography model. A claim that the developer behind the popular mobile video game \"Pokémon GO,\" Niantic Labs, used geolocation data collected from players to build a new artificial intelligence (AI) navigation system circulated online in November 2024. A user on TikTok posted a video sharing his thoughts about the alleged news, causing one user to respond, \"Whaaaaat? The free app was collecting and monetizing your data??? No! Not in 2024!!!\" @unrealwhosane #pokemon #pokemongo ♬ original sound - POLITICAL MEMES The claim was also posted to Reddit , linking to an article on the website ArsTechnica , an outlet self-described as dedicated to \"news and reviews, analysis of technology trends and expert advice on topics ranging from the most fundamental aspects of technology to the many ways technology is helping us discover our world.\" A user on Reddit responded , \"This is why I stopped playing after like two weeks. I bet they have maps of the inside of everyone's home, too.\" Somebody else responded , \"That's the job of the robot vacuum cleaners!\" Another user added , \"So what everyone predicted they were doing when they added the \"scanning pokestops\" mechanic? I'm shocked.\" Indeed, the claim that Niantic used player data in the construction of what the company calls a \"Large Geospatial Model\" is true. However, as the user in the Reddit post pointed out, this data is specific to a portion of the game that directs players to \" scan a PokéStop \" at locations in the real world that Niantic describes as \"great places that encourage exploration, exercise or social interactions with others.\" Users are encouraged to scan PokéStops to gather necessary in-game items. According to a blog post on Niantic's official website, this is the only element of \"Pokémon GO\" that contributes to the machine learning of their AI geography model. The introduction to the post reads: Editor's note: We use player-contributed scans of public real-world locations to help build our Large Geospatial Model. This scanning feature is completely optional – people have to visit a specific publicly-accessible location and click to scan. This allows Niantic to deliver new types of AR [augmented reality] experiences for people to enjoy. Merely walking around playing our games does not train an AI model. This essentially means that players capturing Pokémon without actively scanning these special locations are not contributing to Niantic's geospatial model. However, the company's privacy policy is clear that it is still collecting location data from players. The policy reads, in part, \"Our Services include location-based games whose core feature is to provide an experience tied to your real-world location, so we need to know where you are to operate these apps and games for you and to plan the location of in-game or in-app resources (for example, PokéStops within 'Pokémon GO').\" As for what a \"large geospatial model\" actually does, the company describes it as a 3D evolution of \"large language models\" like ChatGPT. Their description of its alleged functionality is : Imagine yourself standing behind a church. Let us assume the closest local model has seen only the front entrance of that church, and thus, it will not be able to tell you where you are. The model has never seen the back of that building. But on a global scale, we have seen a lot of churches, thousands of them, all captured by their respective local models at other places worldwide. No church is the same, but many share common characteristics. An LGM is a way to access that distributed knowledge. An LGM distills common information in a global large-scale model that enables communication and data sharing across local models. An LGM would be able to internalize the concept of a church, and, furthermore, how these buildings are commonly structured. Even if, for a specific location, we have only mapped the entrance of a church, an LGM would be able to make an intelligent guess about what the back of the building looks like, based on thousands of churches it has seen before. Therefore, the LGM allows for unprecedented robustness in positioning, even from viewpoints and angles that the VPS has never seen. One question raised by the TikTok video that was not addressed in Niantic's blog post was the suggestion that the company had placed PokéStops in locations it still needed to collect data for. However, a representative for Niantic pointed out to Snopes that the creation of PokéStops, a process it calls the Wayfarer program, is user-generated and community-approved. A page on the \"Pokémon GO\" help center says : Once you have reached Level 37, you are eligible to submit Wayspot nominations. A Wayspot is a unique place that exists in the real world, like objects, locations, or landmarks, that would make good additions to the Niantic real-world map. Once submitted, your Wayspot nomination will be evaluated by Niantic's player community. Highly rated nominations may be accepted and added to the Niantic real-world map. Keep in mind that not all accepted nominations will become a PokéStop or even a Gym, however, they may appear in other Niantic games. \"Pokémon GO\" was released in 2016 in the United States, which prompted many fact-checks related to the game from Snopes, including claims that the game helped clear dogs from an animal shelter , that a man trying to catch a Pokémon in Massachusetts caused a major traffic accident , that the game caused a fatal car crash in Tennessee and that \"The Simpsons\" predicted the popularity of the game years before its release .",

    "article_text": "Claim: On Oct. 5, 2021, Snapchat launched a new feature that aims to help young users run for political office. Rating: True About this rating On Oct. 5, 2021, Snopes came across social media posts like the one displayed below questioning if , or why , Snapchat was trying to encourage people to run for political office. The posts' underlying claim — that the social media platform had rolled out a new feature to help users launch campaigns — was true. Sofia Gross, head of policy partnerships and social impact at Snap (the company that oversees the app), tweeted : We also obtained an Oct. 5 news release from Snap that said users could access the portal by opening the app, swiping down on the camera screen, and selecting the \"Run for Office\" in-app game. There, users will find, according to the release: A centralized portal on local elected offices that can be filtered by issue. We created a one stop resource that curates over 75,000 upcoming elections on the federal, state and local level that Snapchatters may be eligible for. Snapchatters identify a set of issues they are passionate about and then we surface roles they may be interested in. Access to experienced candidate recruitment organizations and training programs across the political spectrum. These groups will be connected directly with Snapchatters to help them with the first steps needed to start a campaign. [...] The ability to nominate friends to run for office. Snapchatters say friends were more than five times more influential in their decision to vote in the 2020 election vs. influencers and celebrities. The Run for Office Mini allows Snapchatters to nominate their friends who they see as future leaders. A personalized campaign hub. The ‘My Campaign Dashboard’ will show Snapchatters the first steps they need to take to get on the ballot, including filing deadlines and signature requirements, as well as contact information for local election offices. In addition, Snapchatters will be able to share stickers from this portal to start campaigning on Snapchat with their closest friends. Specifically, the feature aims to connect those above-listed resources with teenagers and young adults. According to the release, Snapchat reaches 90% of U.S. residents between the ages of 13 and 24 and, therefore, can play a role in telling that population about upcoming races. \"We know this next generation is the most diverse,\" the release stated. \"We hope our Run for Office initiative will help shape a more equitable, and reflective, democracy that includes all Americans, including young people.\" Gross' above-displayed tweet included a link to an article by NPR in which Gross said the idea grew from the company's observations during 2020 elections. \"We started meeting with candidate-recruitment organizations to really try to understand if there was a role for Snapchat to play in this space,\" Gross said. \"And the answer [...] was yes, developing candidates is a long-term initiative.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: “Presidential alerts” are capable of accessing the E911 chip in your phones, which provides the government full access to your location, microphone, camera and every function of your phone. Rating: False About this rating On 3 October 2018, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), in coordination with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), conducted a nationwide test of the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) system, an event referred to by many commenters as a “Presidential alert.” On the day of the test, John McAfee, the controversial founder of the McAfee Antivirus software empire and a current cryptocurrency advocate (as well as 2020 U.S. presidential candidate for the Libertarian party), tweeted an alarming statement about the test: The \"Presidential alerts\": they are capable of accessing the E911 chip in your phones - giving them full access to your location, microphone, camera and every function of your phone. This not a rant, this is from me, still one of the leading cybersecurity experts. Wake up people! — John McAfee (@officialmcafee) October 3, 2018 In this post, we'll describe the myriad hurdles McAfee’s argument would need to overcome to be accurate, noting that we could find no independent support for the claims he made in that tweet. What is the Presidential Alert System? The “presidential alert” tested on 3 October 2018 combined a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System, or EAS (which is familiar to people as cacophonous weather and/or natural disaster alerts that might interrupt television or radio broadcasts) and the Wireless Emergency Alert system, or WEA (which is familiar to cell phone users who have received Amber alerts or other local emergency alerts). Typically, the WEA system is used by state and local jurisdictions, but the October 2018 test was the first attempt at trying out a nationwide alert via this system for the purposes of conveying a message from the President. Based on a George W. Bush-era law, anyone with a cell phone can opt out of any WEA notification unless that notification is “issued at the direction of the President and/or his/her designee.” While the law has required the EAS to be tested nationwide for the past three years, October 2018 was the first time such a test had been combined with a test of a nationwide WEA alert. What Is John McAfee’s Argument? In a brief phone interview, McAfee explained to us his view that a nationwide WEA notification could be exploited by the federal government to spy on private citizens. He suggested this could be done by exploiting what he called an \"E911 chip\". He characterized the purpose of this chip as something 911 dispatchers can use to find location information for people who call 911 and either hang up or are incapacitated during the call: Let’s say a burglar enters your house, assaults you, you call 911, you pass out during the call. They again turn on your camera, your phone, get your location, dispatch police officers. They can then listen to see if there is anyone else in the room. Is there any noise? The location of the camera, whatever it's showing, they can see that. Perfect, that's good. I don't think anybody would have a problem with that. We will discuss the accuracy of that statement later in this post. However, McAfee’s argument, generally speaking, is that because (he says) the WEA utilizes this “E911 chip,” they too have the ability to turn on your phone and spy on you: The Federal Government has co-opted a local facility (e.g.,. a 911 call center). Let’s say you want to know where you've got a bunch of enemies or a bunch of Republicans or some Democrats, you want to know where they are, what they're doing. When you send an alert it doesn't have to make a sound. It doesn't have to display anything because it's listening, watching you, to find out where you are, where you're moving. What is an E911 Chip? According to Ted Rappaport, a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at NYU and the founding director of their NYU WIRELESS research center, “There is no such thing as an E911 chip in a cell phone.” Nomenclature aside, McAfee appears to be referring to the technology required by the FCC of modern cellular phones and network providers that assures 911 call centers receive accurate geolocation from mobile phones. The regulations that require such capabilities are broadly referred to as E911 rules. The enhanced 911 (E911) rules were implemented by the FCC in two phases and were aimed at improving “the effectiveness and reliability of wireless 911 services by providing 911 dispatchers with additional information on wireless 911 calls.” Phase I required cell phones to be capable of communicating to a 911 call center which cellphone tower was utilized in an emergency call. Phase II required wireless carriers “to begin providing information that is more precise to [call centers], specifically, the latitude and longitude of the caller.” The FCC mandated that the accuracy of that information had to meet certain standards depending upon the type of technology used. Most modern cell phones use a combination of two methods to generate that location information: A “network-based” solution which triangulates a caller's location from the cell phone towers near it, and a “headset-based” solution which is generally a GPS receiver built into the phone. Most modern cell phones contain a GPS receiver chip. It is this chip, McAfee argued to us, that a presidential alert system could exploit. Does The Wireless Emergency Alert System Use an “E911 Chip”? McAfee asserted that the action of sending out a nationwide alert necessitates access to the GPS or other location services (i.e. the “E911 chip”) that are part of your phone. FEMA, the federal agency that oversees the WEA, disputes this view, with a FEMA spokesperson telling us: The cell phone functions that receive and display WEA messages are not related or connected to E911 functions in any way. The majority of wireless providers in the United States use Cell Broadcast technology to deliver WEA alert messages to cell phones. Cell Broadcast is a one-way communications protocol. Phones that receive WEA messages choose to display the message if the phone is not busy in a phone call or data session. The WEA message display function in a phone does not use the GPS, microphone, or camera functions of the phone. In essence, what happens when any WEA alert (including Amber alerts and severe weather alerts) go out is that the cell towers in the targeted region will broadcast a signal to all cell phones within receiving distance. This is a passive process, and as such the tower does not require, nor does it obtain, information from the phones that receive the message. The only differences between a “Presidential alert” and any other WEA alert a phone might already receive are that 1) cell phones are not capable of opting out of WEA notifications from the President according to FCC policy, and 2) WEA notifications target the entire country, not a smaller geographic region. Could a WEA Alert Exploit Your Phone’s Hardware and Expose Its Location? Because a WEA notification is a passively received signal, it does not add to the list of potential security vulnerabilities in a phone. For that reason, McAfee’s thesis that the presidential alert is itself a security risk does not hold up. That does not mean, however, that your phone and the software it runs on do not have access to a scary amount of personal data, or that it is not constantly tracking your location and recording you. According to Rappaport, the NYU professor, users almost always (without their knowledge) “opt-in” to a variety of services that utilize the kind of information McAfee is concerned with: It is true that various smartphone operating systems, such as Android and iOS, do collect and process the microphone data of unwitting users, and that our locations and voices are indeed being tracked and mined, processed, and known to the cellphone smartphone operating system, and this information, or processed versions of it, are exchanged between the cell phone's operating system and the end servers across the internet that communicate with the end user applications ... A person’s location information and audio recordings (or processed versions of the recordings) are supposed to be only used when a customer has “opted in” to use these applications, and when the application has been downloaded on to its phone). If you read the fine print of both the Android and IOS operating systems ... you will be amazed at what users are agreeing to for the use of their data. This type of data is often used by social media sites (Google, Facebook, etc.) to target their advertising to us. As an experiment, you can talk about your pet, and what you feed your pet, and after a few minutes, you will then find a Facebook ad about pet food in your Facebook feed -- I have many of my friends try this, and they are amazed and then quite shaken up. Outside of the issue of a WEA alert's being a passive signal, McAfee’s thesis also requires accepting the notion that 911 operators have access to those same datasets (the ones described by Rappaport) constantly being created by your phone. That portion of the argument is a bit more factual. As an example, Apple’s iOS 12 system, which was released in September 2018, utilizes a service that collects and packages your location data to be sent to a 911 center should you make a call: Apple today announced it will also use emergency technology company RapidSOS’s Internet Protocol-based data pipeline to quickly and securely share [GPS and networked derived] location data with 911 centers, improving response time when lives and property are at risk. RapidSOS’s system will deliver the emergency location data of iOS users by integrating with many 911 centers’ existing software, which rely on industry-standard protocols ... In keeping with Apple’s focus on privacy, user data cannot be used for any non-emergency purpose and only the responding 911 center will have access to the user’s location during an emergency call. We reached out to RapidSOS for a comment on the claims made by McAfee but have not received a response. We have found no evidence, though, that this process could be flipped in reverse, whereby a 911 call center (or any other party) could access this information without your first calling 911. In fact, based on RapidSOS’s literature , their data transfer process is effectively a one-way signal as well. In their process, your location data is constantly updated and sent to a NG911 (next generation 911) data clearinghouse which is then (if you make a 911 call) transmitted to a call center and displayed alongside the other location data they would normally receive. These data could theoretically include other sources of information, but a user would have to opt-in to those features explicitly. We asked McAfee how he knows that the government, via the introduction of a nationwide alert system, could gain access to this kind of data in a way that did not previously exist before the alert system, and he told us that while no documented evidence of any legislation allowing for such a process existed, “every great security person knows” it: There is no evidence that any legislation gave the government the power to co-opt the 911 call. It was something that was intended to be activated only if I'm in trouble and call the police. Is now being used by the government to send text messages under the pretext of [a test]. I'm the world’s greatest cyber security specialist, which is basically one of the greatest hackers. I know that because every great cyber security person knows this. People have taken that chip, taken it apart a thousand times. Regardless of what chip McAfee is referring to, his claim rests on the notion that receiving a WEA alert requires governmental access to the geolocation services utilized by 911 centers, a claim which we have found no evidence to support and which FEMA denies. While cell phones do collect data on users (effectively) without their knowledge and do so constantly, we could identify no mechanism by which the perils presented by that reality were in anyway expanded by a presidential alert, since those alerts merely use the same technology that cell phones have employed to receive weather and Amber alerts for years. If the government were to have a way of snooping on citizens through their cellphones, it would have to depend on their co-opting some other system and not simply using the presidential alert system as it exists today.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Prominent attorneys are investigating whether Twitter owner Elon Musk lied on his application for U.S. citizenship. Rating: Originated as Satire About this rating On May 24, 2023, a tweet from a pro-Democratic account with over 100,000 followers and a history of misinformation claimed that a \"breaking\" news story suggested \"prominent lawyers\" were working to see if Elon Musk had lied on his application for U.S. citizenship: The fact that @ericareport posted this same tweet in December 2022 is a significant blow to the assertion that the May 2023 tweet contained \"breaking\" information. The fact that the text appearing in that account's tweet appears to have been cut-and-pasted from earlier identical tweets and a Reddit thread on the topic is a further blow. As noted in a December 2022 Newsweek fact check of this claim, the language in the @ericareports tweet is suspiciously similar to an October 2022 tweet from \"lawyer, comedian, and journalist\" Dean Obeidallah: As a lawyer I'm going to do research to see if [Elon Musk] in any way lied on his application for US citizenship. [...]. If he lied anywhere on application we will move to strip him of US citizenship. Several publications including Daily Mail , Fox News , and Western Journal took the assertion seriously. A few hours later, however, Obeidallah — who could, perhaps, be considered a \"prominent attorney\" — tweeted that \"It was never about the document. It was only about the trolling.\" Newsweek \"found no independently verifiable information\" supporting the allegation that Musk was being investigated over immigration issues, adding that \"the 'prominent attorneys' in question were not identified in any of the posts.\" Snopes had not identified any information that could aid in that verification, at the time of this reporting. Unverified or unverifiable rumors about his U.S. citizenship have long been leveled against Musk, as Snopes has previously reported . Because, however, this claim originates from an unsourced copypasta stemming from an assertion made in a tweet described as a \"troll,\" we rate this claim as \"Originated as Satire.\"",

Rating: Originated as Satire About this rating On Aug. 5, 2023, Jim Ferguson, a former candidate for a seat in British Parliament whose social media presence is steeped in false conspiratorial claims , posted to X, the social media outlet formerly known as Twitter, a message about the state of 5G cellular technology in Russia: Citing an article from a purported Bangladeshi news website named dainikbidyaloy.com, Ferguson suggested that Putin had \"ban[ned] 5G across Russia'' and \"destroy[ed] All [5G] Towers,\" suggesting this \"massive step\" likely meant Russia knows something negative about the technology that the West does not. 5G is a cellular technology that operates at a higher frequency band than 4G and can carry more data as a result. Dainikbidyaloy.com is not, in fact, a credible source of information. It is a website that republishes content that originated on Real Raw News , a prolific source of disinformation. The story Ferguson shared to nearly a million people originated on Real Raw News on Aug. 5, 2023 — a site with a satire disclaimer — and asserted that Putin had ordered the end of 5G in Russia and that he even publicly executed a tech executive over it: Russian President Vladimir Putin has banned 5G towers in the Russian Federation amid concerns the technology is medically unsafe and has caused the deaths of school children near St. Petersburg. His mandate wasn't well-received by the Telecom executives. MTS Vice President of 5G Infrastructure Borya Vlasov said the absence of 5G would put Russia at a technological disadvantage, adding that Russia needed 5G to strengthen a once-thriving economy now faltering thanks to Putin's actions in Ukraine. [...] Putin ordered the security agent beside him to shoot Vlasov squarely between the eyes. Without hesitation, the agent drew his Makarov pistol and put a bullet in Vlasov's forehead in full view of 15 people. Real Raw News carries a disclaimer on its \"About Us\" page that says \"Information on this website is for informational and educational and entertainment purposes\" and that it \"contains humor, parody, and satire. In reality, Russia is working to expand 5G access and reduce a technology gap created by the retreat of western telecom technology since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022. In a speech made in June 2023, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin reiterated Putin's plans in the area of \"technological sovereignty,\" which explicitly called for the creation of Russian-made 5G base stations: The disruption of foreign telecom equipment supplies is posing certain challenges, especially in the mobile segment, where Western solutions were traditionally used. To speed up the transition to Russian base stations for LTE and 5G, the Government and market participants have adopted a roadmap for the development of modern networks. It includes several state support programmes, including 3.5 billion roubles in subsidies for the manufacture of the required high-tech devices to be allocated this year. On Aug. 6, 2023, Andrey Zarenin, the deputy minister of digital development, telecommunications, and mass media of the Russian Federation, also spoke of forward progress on 5G technology at a conference of telecom leaders, according to a news release from that ministry.

    "article_text": "Claim: A video shows real robots dancing to the song “Do You Love Me.” Rating: True About this rating Boston Dynamics, a robotics company, posted a video of dancing robots to help usher in 2021 to the tune of \"Do You Love Me\" by The Contours. The video soon went viral , with social media commentary ranging from admiring the robots’ rhythm to others declaring it creepy. We received many questions about the robots, with some readers wondering if they were computer generated instead. We learned that they were not. The source of the dancing robots is a well-known robotics company. Owned by Softbank Group , and recently acquired by Hyundai , Boston Dynamics is known for advanced robots, which include Atlas , a bipedal humanoid robot, and Spot , a quadruped robot. They are featured dancing in this video: This is not the first time the company’s robots impressed the internet. In 2018, Boston Dynamics showed off Atlas’ parkour skills. The company has frequently worked with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the U.S. military , and has used Spot , the quadruped robot, for COVID-19 response efforts, including monitoring patients' vital signs to reduce contact with healthcare workers. Given the reputable nature of the robotics company, and the impact and popularity of their robots, we rate this claim as “True.”",

    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: Special apps and software can remove strategically placed stickers from Facebook photos, leaving children and others open to unwanted exposure online. Rating: False About this rating In September 2021, social media users enthusiastically shared an inaccurate warning about special software and apps that could, supposedly, remove strategically placed stickers and emojis from photos of children posted online, thus potentially leaving kids exposed or with their privacy violated online. The meme had been shared very widely , on Facebook in particular, throughout 2020 and 2021, but enjoyed a resurgence in September, for reasons that are unclear. The screenshot below shows just a selection of examples from Facebook, demonstrating its popularity on that platform: It contained the following text: So apparently there's [sic] apps that can remove stickers from Facebook pictures.. I've had a google and I have found it to be true.. After a bit of digging I found that the only way to censor your images it [sic] actually rub it out with the eraser tool.. adding stickers adds layers to the image that can be removed quite easily with the right apps or software.. Please be cautious when posting pictures of your babies when censored with Facebook stickers... In reality, no apps exist that can \"remove layers\" from photos uploaded to Facebook or other social networks, thus leaving children and others open to unwanted exposure. Though well-meaning, such warnings were fundamentally inaccurate, and we are issuing a rating of \"False.\" The overwhelming majority of images and photos uploaded to, and downloaded from, social networks like Facebook and its subsidiary Instagram, are in one of two file formats: JPEG (or JPG) or PNG. Those formats consist of only one image layer, which means it is not possible to extract, edit, or remove a background layer (e.g., an original photograph) or a top layer (e.g. a \"sticker\" added using Facebook's image editing tool). The Facebook and Instagram \"stories\" feature does use image layers, so there is a grain of truth in the assertion that \"adding stickers adds layers to the image.\" That layering is what allows a user to, for example, add a sticker or a block of text (the top layer) on top of a photograph (the background layer). However, once the resulting composite image is uploaded to Facebook or Instagram, those multiple layers are \"collapsed\" or \"flattened\" into one layer. Another user could download the resulting image but could not unilaterally gain access to the original separate layers and could not, as the viral warning claims, \"remove\" one of those layers in order to reveal a hidden part of the other layer. The only way in which an individual could gain access to the original layers of a composite image (for example a photo of a baby and a \"sticker\" placed over the face) would be if the creator shared the original files with the individual, or shared a file from an image editor, such as a \"PSD\" file in Adobe Photoshop, or an \"XCF\" file in GIMP. In such a scenario, the concern over unwanted access to raw images would not arise, because the creator would be voluntarily sharing them anyway. Apps do exist that claim to be able to remove emojis and stickers from pictures, but they are either bogus , or provide a very different image-editing service, namely cloning or \" clone stamping .\" Clone stamping works by taking a single-layer image, selecting a sample from its background, and then covering over an object so as to give the appearance of having \"removed\" that object. However, background cloning can only simulate the background behind an object — if the image file consists of only one layer, it is not possible for the user to actually remove an object and see the real background that was hidden by that object.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Twitter is removing users' ability to view tweets chronologically when using a web browser. Rating: False About this rating On June 26, some Twitter users noticed that they were unable to switch from the default timeline mode based on algorithms to the chronological timeline mode when using a web browser application. A few days later, tech website 9to5mac wrote an article stating that chronological tweets \"seemingly won't last\": Twitter is making a controversial change to its web application. Until recently, Twitter on the web allowed users to easily switch between an algorithmic feed and a chronological feed with a single click, but that option is now being removed completely for people who use Twitter in their browser. ... In recent days, however, Twitter has started to remove the ability to view Latest Tweets first from the Twitter.com web application. For many users, the toggle between “Latest Tweets” and “Home” has been completely removed. The option is still there for some users, but it seemingly won’t last. An added bit of support for this thesis came from out-of-date or conflicting information from Twitter, as reported by The Verge: Adding to the confusion, Twitter’s page explaining the timeline has a bullet saying that switching between top tweets (aka tweets served up algorithmically) and latest tweets is a feature that’s only available on iOS and Android. Some took this to mean that the option was really going away, but it turns out that the line has been there for years, according to the WayBack Machine . It’s possible the line is just a holdover from when the “sparkle” button was first introduced , because it conflicts with information that shows up later in the article: Twitter includes instructions on how to change your timeline order for the web at the bottom of the page. There are, however, no plans to remove the option to view tweets chronologically, according to Twitter . Responding to the 9to5mac article, Twitter product lead Kayvon Beykpour tweeted that the issue was a bug and that they were \"working on fixing it.\" Later, Twitter announced that the problem had been fixed: Because the issue was caused by a bug that has since been corrected, we rate the claim that the option to view tweets chronologically is disappearing as \"False.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: A photograph authentically shows an antique reusable grocery list from the 1920s. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True The reusable grocery list was an authentic item invented in the 20th century. However... What's False It was invented in the 1950s, not the 1920s as a viral Twitter post claimed. Fact Check A photograph shared widely on social media authentically shows an antique reusable grocery list from the 1950s — not the 1920s, as some online posters have claimed . One such post was so popular that it was shared by over 18,000 people and liked nearly 244,000 times. We’d like to take credit for this debunk, but that credit is due science writer Joe Hanson , who took to a Twitter thread in August 2022 to show his process in the “fine art of baloney detection.” As Hanson pointed out, spaghetti and frozen foods weren’t “everyday items” in the U.S. until after World War II. Though frozen peas, for example, were popularized in the 1920s, it wasn’t until the 1940s that frozen foods were largely available to consumers, noted Wiltshire Farm Foods . That’s because, in part, refrigerators weren’t widely available until Freon , the cooling agent in freezers, was more widely used in the 1940s. Of course, there’s the possibility that the list was made in another English-speaking country with a different history of foods, so we plugged the picture into a reverse image search engine , just to be sure. Just as Hanson noted in his thread, a search on TinEye revealed that the image in question had been posted on the internet at least 55 times, including to sites like Pinterest , Reddit and Imgur , since at least 2020. The photograph was also featured by the Daily Mail in April 2021, where it was referenced as a “metal-block shopping list from the 1940s.” Antique fanatics also had a few things to say on forums about when the item was likely used. Some of these posters also shared similar devices for sale on Ebay and Etsy , and also noted that the grocery list was likely from the 1940s or 1950s. Hanson added that the back was “stamped ‘Patent Pending’” and decided to do a bit more digging. “That means that in whatever year this was made a patent application had already been filed in the U.S. but not granted. If we can find that app, it'll give us the earliest possible year of manufacture,” he wrote . “Luckily one of our antique detectives already tracked down the patent for us…” And a quick Google search for \"Benjamin Robbio patent\" returned an issue of the U.S. Patent Office official gazette that detailed the newly invented grocery list: It was described as: A memorandum device comprising a hollow body having a top wall, indicia on the obverse face of said wall at spaced locations therealong, a one-piece supporting plate within said body having a longitudinal opening therein, a spring member secured to said plate, said spring member bridging said opening and resting on said plate at the opposite edges thereof, individual movable keys projecting through said wall, each key located to serve one of said spaced indicia and movable into at least two positions with reference to said indicia to selectively designate said indicia, a surface of each of said keys extending into engagement with said spring member at a location thereon between the edges of said opening to be tensioned and held by said spring member in one of said two selected positions. And like Hanson pointed out , this photograph is a classic case of recycled content whose context and background has gradually deteriorated over the dozens of times it has been reshared. So while the photograph in question features a very real product, it was patented and subsequently sold in the 1950s. Or was it? Just kidding. Hat-tip to Hanson for his careful reporting and dynamic way of sharing with the internet how quickly rumors can be debunked if we spend a little bit of time doing the heavy lifting. For the record, Rush Kazi, whose tweet went viral after reposting the photograph in August, said in a subsequent tweet that there was a picture in a “Simpsons group saying it was from the 20s.” Kazi then Googled it and found an article saying that it “could be from the 20s,\" but as we now know, it was not.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A video shows a robot bodyguard protecting the king of Bahrain. Rating: Miscaptioned About this rating In January 2022, a video supposedly showing a robot bodyguard protecting the king of Bahrain was re-circulated on social media: This video was often accompanied by a piece of text that supposedly described the robot bodyguard's abilities. One iteration posted to Facebook claimed that it spoke six languages and was armed with an electric taser, three hidden machine guns (with enough ammo to fight 1,000 people), a \"laser guided sniper machine gun,\" a 360-degree camera, an infrared camera, medical supplies, and water. According to this post, the robot cost over $7 million. While the above-displayed video is real, it does not show a robotic bodyguard, let alone one equipped with a \"laser guided sniper machine gun\" protecting the king of Bahrain. This video was filmed at Abu Dhabi's International Defense Exhibition in 2019 and shows Titan, an 8-foot-tall robot developed by the British company Cyberstein Robots. While Titan may be intimidating, this robot isn't a \"bodyguard.\" It's an entertainment robot that was at the conference primarily to entertain attendees. Gulf News reported : The greeter at Abu Dhabi's International Defence Exhibition is making a buzz on social media, as nobody expected to meet a bilingual, eight feet tall robot ... While nations were signing contracts and millions of dollar were spent behind closed doors, the greeter at Idex brought a lighter side to the exhibition. Here's another video of Titan at this exhibition. Titan made its debut in 2004 when the robot appeared onstage with Rihanna at the Glastonbury Music & Arts Festival. Since then, the robot has appeared alongside A-list celebrities, such as Will Smith, Jackie Chan, and Hugh Jackman, and has made numerous appearances on talk shows and tech conferences. Titan has gone through several revisions since then. Nick Fielding, the creator of Titan, said that Titan really took off after working with voiceover artists to create custom dialogue for the robot. Not only does this allow the company to customize Titan's script per event, but dialogue can be recorded in a variety of languages. Fielding said : \"One of the biggest developments within our company was when we started working with a very well-known TV voiceover artist. He now voices all of Titan's dialogue. He has given Titan a character and a wisecracking wit that has taken our show to a whole new level ... We can now produce scripts and bespoke dialogue for Titan. He can give seminar speeches, product demonstrations or promotional videos etc. In fact, the only thing that limits what we can do these days is the client's imagination.\" Here's a video of Titan sarcastically interacting with a crowd at the Bett Exhibition in 2020: In sum, this robot is not equipped with machine guns and laser-guided weapons, and hasn't been tasked with providing security detail for high-profile clients. This 8-foot-tall robot is equipped with sarcasm and has been tasked with entertaining attendees at tech conferences.",

Rating: False About this rating On May 3, 2023, a video went viral that appeared to show a robot doing military drills. In the video, the robot seems to shoot guns at targets, cross a few hurdles, engage in combat, and even put the gun down when a human target faces him at gunpoint. The robot also gets beaten up and pushed around by its human handlers. This is not an authentic video of a robot engaging in military drills. The robot was artificially rendered using computer-generated imagery (CGI), based on a live performance by a man in a costume before visual effects were employed to change his appearance. The original video was posted in October 2019 by Corridor , a production company, and was titled \"New Robot Makes Soldiers Obsolete.\" A few days later Corridor posted another video showing the creative process behind the making of \"New Robot Makes Soldiers Obsolete,\" admitting that the robot was made using visual effects. The behind-the-scenes video, titled \"Combat Robots: VFX Before & After Reveal\" shows the robot carrying out military drills, but the bottom right video shows that the robot was actually played by a man in a suit whose appearance was then digitally edited to make him look like a robot. Another behind-the-scenes video titled \"We Used CGi to Fake Military Robots\" gave more detail on how they managed to create a robot. The video also mentions Boston Dynamics , a robotics design company that has designed real robots that are able to dance and do backflips, among other skills. On camera, the video creators discussed whether or not Boston Dynamics' robots were eventually going to end up as combatants. One of them asked, \"What is the military testing version of Boston Dynamics look like?\" They also joked that they would create their version of these robots and call the production, \"Bosstown Dynamics 2.\" We have often encountered questions from our community about whether certain videos of robots are CGI or real. In the past, we fact-checked a CGI robot supposedly demonstrating martial arts skills that was being falsely passed off as a Boston Dynamics creation. We also tracked down the origins of a viral video of (real) dancing robots that were, in fact, Boston Dynamics creations. While companies like Boston Dynamics have created robots with impressive physical skills , the above video is a clear example of how robots depicted using computer-generated visual effects can easily be mistaken for the real thing.",

You can watch the video, tweeted by the verified account of an Indian politician and actor, below: The tweet claims that these dancers were \"robots made in China,\" and this five minute performance was broadcast at Shanghai Disneyland. The same language has been circulating in others' tweets when sharing this video. The origin of this performance was actually a 2013 clip from British television show “Strictly Come Dancing\" that aired on BBC One. The performers were Abbey Clancy and Aljaž Škorjanec, who were dancing the Viennese waltz. You can see the performance shared from the official BBC YouTube account: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpcAIFNVFfM&feature=youtu.be This false rumor is similar to another one from 2019 that claimed Chinese classical dancer Qin Xi was actually a robot performing at Shanghai’s Disneyland. Given that the actual video shows two very real people dancing on a British television show, and not two robots, we rate this claim as “False.”",

    "article_text": "Claim: A map shared online authentically documents how “all roads lead to Rome.” Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True The map was created using genuine data and explores the idiom \"All roads lead to Rome,\" its makers say. However ... What's False It's more accurately described as a \"data visualization\" or \"infographic,\" since it is not a genuine road map. Context The image was created using genuine data, but is described by its creators as a “data visualization project that explores the idiom, ‘all roads lead to Rome.’” It’s an infographic “art-data,” not a genuine road map. The proverb \" All roads lead to Rome \" is said to have originated in relation to the Roman monument known as the Milliarium Aureum, or golden milestone. Erected by Caesar, the point was said to be at the center from which all distances in the Roman Empire were measured. In the 21st century, the old adage was revamped when a graphic began circulating in 2015 that claimed to show how all roads still, in a sense, lead to Rome in the modern era. One such iteration was shared again to X on Aug. 6, 2024. At the time of this publication, the image had received more than 62.6 million views. While the image shown above was created in 2015 using genuine data, its creators describe it as a \"data visualization project that explores the idiom, 'all roads lead to Rome.'\" In other words, the image is better described as an infographic or \"data art,\" not a genuine road map. For these reasons, we have rated this claim as a \"Mixture.\" Snopes traced the map to a website published by Philipp Schmitt , an artist and designer, on which he describes the map as having been made with antidisciplinary designer Benedikt Groß . The map was made while the two were at the former research facility moovel Lab . In a December 2015 post, Groß described the project as follows: The outcome is both information visualization and data art and unveils mobility patterns at a very large scale. The visualizations were created using routing algorithms on existing street infrastructure from the city to continent scale. The resulting images bring insights into the ways in which road infrastructure reflect regional, political and geographical situations. The project is a thought experiment that shows nearly half a million ways a person could get to Rome from major Western European cities. Though the project website is no longer online, an archived version from January 2021 is available through the Wayback Machine. To begin, the team aligned starting points in a more than 10-million-square-mile grid covering all of Europe. Each cell in the grid contained a starting point to one of the team's \"journeys to Rome.\" There are then 486,713 starting points to reach Rome. So, the team created an algorithm that calculated one route leading to Rome for every analyzed European starting point. The team wrote: The calculation and presentation of these different routes is based on different pieces of open source software. GraphHopper was our central tool for routing our journeys. In total GraphHopper ran 20 hours while calculating all the routes displayed on the maps. GraphHopper works with Open Street Map data, which has also been essential for our project. The calculation and presentation of these different routes is based on different pieces of open source software. GraphHopper was our central tool for routing our journeys. In total GraphHopper ran 20 hours while caluculating all routes displayed on the maps. GraphHopper works with Open Street Map data , which has also been essetial for our project. At the time of the project in 2015, it took GraphHopper on the team's MacPro more than five hours to calculate the more than 400,000 European routes to Rome. \"The maps as an outcome of this project are somewhere between information visualization and data art, unveiling mobility at a very large scale,\" wrote the team. Hayley Drennon , a senior research assistant at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory who is not affiliated with the project, further confirmed that the image is based on \"an algorithm that highlights all roads leading to a point.\" Drennon likens the map to \"six degrees from Kevin Bacon\" or \"Bacon's Law,\" a concept based on the notion that everyone in the world is connected by six or fewer acquaintances. \"Any large metropolitan city will have major roads coming into it. We can also say that 'all roads lead to Paris' or 'every road in America leads to Atlanta,\" Drennon told Snopes. \"Because, let's be honest, roads are like a circulatory system.\" The Rome map was presented at the 2016 IEEE Visualization Conference , an annual gathering on scientific visualization, information visualization, and visual analytics administrated by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Visualization and Graphics. Map creators Groß, Schmitt, and Raphael Reimann are listed on page 18 of the conference agenda. Snopes also found a project description (full text visible here ) submitted to the 2016 IEEE VIS conference with more information about the project. Its abstract read: The proverb 'all roads lead to Rome' is, by a closer look, a very interesting suggestive mobility statement. The goal of the 'Roads to Rome' was to find an automated way to visualize this saying. During the process of finding the right methods and approaches the authors encountered several inspiring further threads of ideas. The authors created maps using algorithms for routing from multiple starts to a single destination and also multiple destinations. The researchers also used the developed methodology on a small scale to visualize mobility network diagrams of selected cities. The resulting images are not only visually intriguing, but also allow conclusions about how road infrastructure reflects regional, political and geographical situations. In the project description, the authors refer to the maps as \"data art\" used to \"incorporate the aesthetics of art while basing on the principles of real world routing and large scale data processing.\" In other words, the project goal was to \"find an automated way to visualize the proverb,\" all roads lead to Rome. The team concludes its work with a disclaimer: The different maps and figures being the result of 'Roads to Rome' show how mobility at scale can be visualized. Keeping in mind, that this project is a borderline case of 'data-art' it does allow interpretations, but should be handled with care when making decisions needing hard proof for example in infrastructure planning. Nevertheless, since closely connected to real datasets it can be seen as a great entry point for mobility discussions, especially concerning street networks, politics and geography. Collectively, the Rome map – as well as those made by the team to depict other European and American cities – show how mobility at scale can be visualized. (Groß, Schmitt, Reimann )",

    "article_text": "Claim: Samsung once used a “butt robot” — i.e., a device in the shape of human glutes — to apply pressure on cell phones in development to test their durability. Rating: True About this rating Context According to the company, the device was used in 2014 and 2018. It wasn't known whether the contraption was a part of new-product testing between or after those years, nor whether it was being used at the time of this writing. Samsung, the electronics manufacturer, supposedly once used a \"butt robot\" to sit on cell phones in development to test their durability, according to an August 2023 Reddit post . \"The robot exerts 220 pounds of pressure on their phones during testing,\" the post claimed, and \"even wears jeans.\" TIL Samsung created a butt shaped robot that sits on their phones to test their durability. The robot exerts 220 pounds of pressure on their phones during testing. The robot even wears jeans. by u/TheQuietKid22 in todayilearned The Reddit post included a photo supposedly showing the \"butt robot\" — a pear-shaped contraption indeed wearing denim jeans and what appeared to be two mobile, metal plates. The claim was true, and the photo was accurately captioned. The image was from an official blog post by Samsung published in 2018. According to the company, the device was used in 2014 and 2018, and indeed put 220 pounds of pressure on new products to see how they could handle it. It wasn't known whether the contraption was part of new-product testing between or after those years, or whether it was being used at the time of this writing. (Snopes reached out to Samsung with that question and will update this report when or if it receives a response.) Through a reverse-image search , Snopes learned the photo and claim were shared to the same Reddit thread in December 2022. Both posts included a link to a November 2018 article by TechRadar, a business and computer-reporting publication, describing the test. By combing through Samsung's online news releases, we found the 2014 blog post with a link to the above-mentioned video showing the \"butt robot\" and an explanation for why the company administered the test . The blog post was published after the spring 2013 rollout of the Galaxy 4, one of Samsung's best-selling smartphones . The blog post read: The back pockets, on our pants, are awesome. We know they are vulnerable to pickpockets and have a greater chance of spilling the contents every time we sit, but we can't resist it. The back pocket is still home to many wallets, keys, phones, etc. And apparently, our hips are strong – stronger than we give it credit for. Leaving things in your back pocket can lead to, well, bent things. Hence the question: what about my phone? Namely, the Galaxy Note 4 . Samsung makes and sells hundreds of millions of smart devices each year, and it's very important that each and every one is in line with its strict quality control standards. So, to make sure you can rely on its devices, including Galaxy Note 4 , Samsung runs rigorous tests both during and after development and production. Check out the video below for some of the tests that Samsung runs to give you, and your back pocket, peace of mind. The video linked in the blog post was listed as \"private\" on YouTube and not viewable to Snopes, as of this publication. But we found an archived version by searching the URL through Wayback Machine, an internet archiving site. (Also, a YouTube user uploaded a version of the video here .) Looking at the archived page, the video was first posted to YouTube by the SamsungTomorrow channel on Oct. 1, 2014, with the title, \"Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Endures the Gluteus Maximus.\" SamsungTomorrow was a YouTube channel established in 2010 and registered to Samsung. As of this writing, the same URL from the SamsungTomorrow page (https://www.youtube.com/user/SamsungTomorrow) redirected to Samsung's official YouTube profile for sharing company news. A second blog post published by Samsung on Nov. 19, 2018, included the photo of the \"butt robot.\" The post titled, \"Lab Tour: How Samsung is Ensuring the Reliability of Galaxy Devices,\" was split into sections with a series of images accompanying each. The in-question photo was under the \"Durability\" section (on the fourth slide), with the written description: Durability is also tested with a series of repetitive actions, such as pressing the buttons, using the earphone jacks and opening the SIM card tray. The team even measures how well a smartphone can withstand the load and pressure of a person sitting on their phone when its in their back pocket. Other tests on new products described in the 2018 blog post included an acoustic chamber to measure audio quality, a heat lab equipped with a thermal camera, a \"drop test lab\" that used high-speed cameras to take footage of smartphones falling, and water experiments.",

    "article_text": "Claim: In July 2022, Saudi Arabia announced plans to construct a 100-mile-long “skyscraper megacity.” Rating: True About this rating Context Whether the plans are feasible, or will come to fruition, remains to be seen. Fact Check For half a decade, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has touted the futuristic, utopian — and perhaps implausible — city of the future named Neom. Plans for the revolutionary metropolis once again made headlines in July 2022 when bin Salman released a proposal for the backbone of the city, known as “The Line.” A video of the prospective city near the Gulf of Aqaba and its centric “ infrastructure spine ” were shared to Reddit and TikTok: With an outer mirror facade, The Line is a skyscraper planned to one day house 9 million residents and is intended to blend in with nature, despite it being a tenth-of-a-mile wide and 105 miles long. “The designs revealed today for the city's vertically layered communities will challenge the traditional flat, horizontal cities and create a model for nature preservation and enhanced human livability. THE LINE will tackle the challenges facing humanity in urban life today and will shine a light on alternative ways to live,” said bin Salmon. With a high-speed rail offering end-to-end transit of 20 minutes, the concept for The Line is based on vertical layering – that is, layering amenities like parks, pedestrian areas, and homes across different levels. All amenities will be accessible within a five-minute walk, say planners. The newly released plans were covered by a number of reputable news publications, including The Guardian , The Washington Post , and Bloomberg . While it’s true that the plans have been released, it’s not yet clear whether they are feasible. As they say, if something is too good to be true, chances are that it may be. The prince first announced plans for Neom in 2017 as part of his Vision 2030 reform plan. In July, planners of Neom published a news release that offered more details about the enigmatic “civilization revolution,” releasing with it some of the finer city details. Speaking to Reuters , bin Salmon said the $500 billion flagship project will be partially financed through a public offering and private sector investment in 2024. City design will be completely digitized and includes intentions of being 100% renewable. Whether or not it will happen remains to be seen. As the tech news website Verge wrote, promotional footage of the city is “the result of some very excitable marketing execs and a fortnight of all-nighters in Blender.” As the Neom website notes, the urban metropolis is touted as a home “for people who dream big.”",

    "article_text": "Claim: A video game set to be released in June 2018 allowed players to assume the role of a school shooter. Rating: True About this rating In May 2018, survivors of the Parkland school shooting massacre, and many others both on and off social media, responded with horror at reports of a video game in which players could assume the role of a school shooter. Jaclyn Corin, a survivor of the Feb. 14, 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, called the game (which is titled Active Shooter ) \"disgusting\" in a tweet and urged others to sign a petition calling for the game not to be released. (The online petition garnered almost 100,000 signatures within four days.) Ryan Petty, whose 14-year-old daughter Alaina was killed in the shooting rampage, accused Valve Corporation (the Bellevue, Washington, company that runs the Steam platform on which the game would be distributed and run) of \"trying to profit from the glamorization of tragedies affecting our schools across the country\" and also called the game \"disgusting.\" The game was indeed real: it was published by a Russian company called Acid and developed by Revived Games (featuring games such as Furry , Tyde Pod Challenge , and White Power: Pure Voltage . which carries the following description: \"The Underworld is an alternate dimension existing in parallel to the human species world. It contains the same parts of the Universe as humanity does, but much more in a darker, colder and hostile manner.\") Active Shooter ' s descriptive entry on Steam's web site read as follows: Pick your role, gear up and fight or destroy! Be the good guy or the bad guy. The choice is yours! Only in \"Active Shooter\", you will be able to pick the role of an Elite S.W.A.T member or the actual shooter. A video preview of the game showed a shooter armed with a rifle, handgun, and knife stalking the classrooms and corridors of a school, shooting at both police and civilians while a \"kill counter\" shows the number of \"cops\" and \"civ\" (civilians) the player had murdered. Every civilian shown in the preview video appeared to be female: In a difficult-to-follow post on May 23, 2018, the game's publisher claimed that Active Shooter \"does not promote any sort of violence, especially any soft [sic] of a mass shooting.\" The publisher went on to note that the game will probably not allow players to assume the role of the shooter by the time the game is released: After receiving such high amount of critics and hate, I will more likely remove the shooters role in this game by the release, unless if it can be kept as it is right now. We asked Valve Corporation whether Active Shooter would still be released on June 6, 2018, and if so, whether it would still feature the shooter mode. We did not receive a response to our query, but shortly afterwards we noticed that Acid's games were no longer listed among Steam's offerings. Subsequently, the gaming news web site PC Gamer reported that both the publisher and developer of the game -- Acid and Revived Games -- had been removed from the Steam platform. PC Gamer quoted what it called a \"Valve rep\" as saying that the publisher and developer were the same person: This developer and publisher is, in fact, a person calling himself Ata Berdiyev, who had previously been removed last fall when he was operating as '[bc]Interactive' and 'Elusive Team'. Ata is a troll, with a history of customer abuse, publishing copyrighted material, and user review manipulation. His subsequent return under new business names was a fact that came to light as we investigated the controversy around his upcoming title. We are not going to do business with people who act like this towards our customers or Valve. In mid-June, Acid announced plans to offer Active Shooter for purchase via its own platform. On June 26, they posted a notice to that effect on the Steam community board, noting that Active Shooter had been renamed Standoff . As of September 2019, Active Shooter was still listed among Acid's offerings and a sequel , Standoff: Lockdown , was also available for sale.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A video shared on social media in 2024 genuine showed a sea monster. Rating: Fake About this rating A video shared on social media in June 2024 claimed to depict a sea serpent monster known as the \" leviathan .\" The clip showed what appeared to be Google Earth or Maps data of an island that, when zoomed in, showed people riding a boat next to a two-eyed, reptilian-like creature just below the surface of the water. A reverse image search found that the same video had been shared across social media platforms and websites alike, including MSN , YouTube, X and Instagram . The video is fake. A mapping expert said someone stitched the clip together using genuine satellite data, such as that obtained through Google Earth or Google Maps, and an animation from one of the many film versions of \"Godzilla.\" Some instances of the video included a TikTok watermark for the profile @hidden.on.google.earth, which originally posted the clip on June 6, 2024. A caption with the video read in part, \"Wtf is hiding in the ocean…\" The account posts other clips that similarly display satellite data, presumably from Google Earth, as a hand zooms in and manipulates the video to give the appearance of a walk-through of genuine data. Some of those videos also purported to show monster-like contact, including one that claimed to have found Godzilla in Tokyo and another with an explosive scene of a large water feature and monster. A matching profile on Instagram is identified as an \"Entertainment website\" Snopes contacted the account through an email listed on its TikTok profile for further information about how the video was made. We will update this article if we receive a response. Hayley Drennon , a senior research assistant at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory , identified the location in the video as Guichan Island in Tawaian, which can be seen on Google Earth here . Furthermore, Drennon noted that images like those showing ocean seascapes are collected using satellites in space. In most locations, this does not allow for a deeper look at locations below the ocean's surface. Similarly, most satellite systems that currently acquire data imagery of the ocean do not take images at a resolution high enough that would show a human face, said Drennon. It's a different technology than is used for Google's Street View images, for example, which are taken from a vehicle and allow for a closer look at objects on the ground. Even if the data collection system was able to capture faces, Google's blurring technology is \"designed to blur identifiable faces.\" Drennon highlighted a scene taken from the video that shows a highly pixelated oceanside mountain. If a large landmass is pictured at this low of a resolution, it's unlikely that the picturing technology would have been able to capture the detail of individual faces. (TikTok/@hidden.on.google.earth) \"Also, it should be noted that the 'monster' is Godzilla,\" said Drennon, noting that the pictures of the \"leviathan\" and people appear to have been mixed in with authentic data. Also known as Turtle Island for its turtle-like shape, Guichan Island measures about 1 square mile and is a major attraction for tourists and scientists alike. NASA writes that satellite images of Guishan Island collected in 2021 show a \"distinct area of light-blue water near the 'turtle's head,'\" adding: The discoloration is the result of dozens of hydrothermal vents on the seafloor dispensing sulfur-rich volcanic plumes. Sulfur, sulfur bacteria, and gas bubbles make the water surface appear milky white, earning the area the nickname \"Milky Sea.\" According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , hydrothermal vents are submarine hot springs that form near underwater volcanoes. They are caused by seawater percolating through fissures in the ocean crust. Snopes has debunked other videos that also appear to show scary scenes incorporated into Google Earth or Maps data, including one scene that was said to show \" zombies \" and another that claimed to have found a dead body . Our newsroom has also examined whether a giant snake skeleton named \"Titanoboa\" was shown on Google Maps, a woman stranded on a desert island was seen in Google Earth data, and a purported airplane crash in the ocean .",

    "article_text": "Claim: Cybercriminals are using public USB ports in places like airports and hotels to introduce malware and monitoring software onto users' devices, posing a serious security threat. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True According to government agencies, \"juice-jacking\" is a real security threat. The FBI’s Denver Office and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) warned travelers in April 2023 about the potential dangers of using public charging stations. What's Undetermined While it is technically possible for criminals to steal information and/or install malware via public USB ports, no evidence has been presented that the practice is widespread. On April 6, 2023, FBI's Denver office issued a warning about \"juice-jacking,\" a form of cyber attack in which information is stolen by installing malware on a person's phone or other portable device via a public USB port. \"Avoid using free charging stations in airports, hotels or shopping centers,\" warned the FBI's Denver office wrote in a tweet . \"Bad actors have figured out ways to use public USB ports to introduce malware and monitoring software onto devices. Carry your own charger and USB cord and use an electrical outlet instead.\" (FBI Denver/Twitter) Five days later, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) did the same. \"Think twice before using public charging stations,\" the FCC tweeted on April 11, 2023. \"Hackers could be waiting to gain access to your personal information by installing malware and monitoring software to your devices. This scam is referred to as juice jacking.\" The FCC also provided a link to its page about the warning. The warnings were carried widely by the news media . But neither the FBI nor the FCC provided any figures about how widespread the threat was. Nor did they explain why they thought it fit to reissue the warning. Snopes did a fact-check on a similar warning from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office in 2019 and found no evidence that the cyber threat was widespread at that time. Snopes reached out to both the FBI and the FCC to request data about how widespread the threat of juice-jacking is in 2023. The FBI replied that its tweet was a \"standard PSA-type post\" that stemmed from the FCC warning. An FCC spokesperson told Snopes that the commission wanted to make sure that their advisory on \"juice-jacking,\" first issued in 2019 and later updated in 2021, was up-to-date so as to ensure \"the consumers have the most up-to-date information.\" The official, who requested anonymity, added that they had not seen any rise in instances of consumer complaints about \"juice-jacking.\"",

    "claim": "A new Facebook feature enabling users to report problems by shaking their phones has caused some users to be inadvertently reported for abuse and suspended.",
    "rating": "Mostly False",
    "article_text": "Claim: A new Facebook feature enabling users to report problems by shaking their phones has caused some users to be inadvertently reported for abuse and suspended. Rating: Mostly False About this rating What's True Facebook has begun rolling out a 'shake-to-report' feature in their mobile app. What's False The feature does not collect reports about abusive posts or other terms-of-service violations and cannot accidentally trigger account suspensions. Did you know Facebook's mobile app has a new feature that allows users to report problems by shaking their phones? No? Neither did we, until readers alerted us to a viral Facebook post claiming that a new \"shake-to-report\" feature was inadvertently landing some people in \"Facebook jail\" (meaning their accounts had been suspended). Warnings such as this one started to appear online in mid-June 2019: Here's the text of the post, minus emojis: PSA FACEBOOK NEEDS TO STOP AVOID FB JAIL I shook my phone and it's a REAL thing! It took me a little bit, but it really is a thing! I turned mine off! Your public service announcement for today: The recent FB update added this new feature for mobile fb users. Since this update - some people have landed in FB jail multiple times (yes, it’s a real place and there’s no fair trial or bail out options!) One has been in & out for over a week now It seems many of us are accidentally ‘reporting a problem’ and getting our friends thrown in jail. How can you fix it? When you’re in FB, shake your phone around until this shows up. Then slide that ‘shake phone to report a problem’ button to OFF! It’s CRAZY that none of us knew this had been added and that it was automatically ON with the update. Fix your phones - Let’s keep our friends (and me lol) out of FB jail! This is no joke shake your phone! Not fast or hard. I just removed mine. 'Shake to Report' Is a Real Feature With little-to-no fanfare, Facebook began rolling out a new \"shake-to-report\" feature in their mobile app in late May 2019. The tech news website Engadget described the rollout on 28 May: Facebook wants to make reporting bugs as easy as shaking your phone. In fact, that's all you'll have to do. Thanks to a new feature, when you encounter a bug, you can simply shake your phone and file a report through a pop-up menu that will appear on the screen. The \"shake to report\" method was previously available as an opt-in feature on iOS, and it will soon be a default setting on both iOS and Android. You'll still be able to report bugs through Facebook's Help & Support menu, but the company says it's hoping this new method will be easier to use. In addition to reporting when News Feed doesn't load or a video won't play, Facebook also wants users to report when they can't figure out how to complete an action, like how to delete a story. Facebook is rolling this out to a small percentage of users globally, but within the next two weeks, it should be available to everyone. Facebook confirmed all this in an email to Snopes.com, including that \"shake to report\" is enabled by default. The easiest way to find out if you have it is to run the Facebook app, then give your phone a gentle shake. A pop-up screen should appear giving you the option of reporting a problem or disabling the shake-to-report feature altogether: (You can access the same screen via the main Facebook app menu, under Help & Support > Report a Problem .) What This Doesn't Mean There are two more things to notice about the screen \"Shake phone to report a problem\": First, it doesn't automatically send a report to Facebook. It provides a link to a report form requiring the user to explain the problem. That means a report can't be sent accidentally. Second, it clearly says that the shake-to-report feature is to report \"something isn't working,\" not to report abusive posts or other terms-of-service violations. Note that a link is offered at the bottom to call up instructions for reporting abuse (see Facebook's help page for those instructions). That means you can't use the shake-to-report feature for issues other than technical ones. In summary, is the \"shake-to-report\" feature real? Yes, and if it has been rolled out to your app, it's automatically enabled. You can disable it (if you wish to) by shaking your phone to call up the screen and turning it off, or by doing the same via the app's Help & Support menu. Is it possible to inadvertently send reports or suspend someone's account by using the feature? No, that's not how it works. You might want to share this information with friends who are spreading the rumor.",

    "rating": "True",
    "article_text": "Claim: A video shows the view from inside a train in Singapore whose windows automatically blind themselves when near residential areas. Rating: True About this rating A video of a futuristic-looking train with windows that become opaque when it approaches residential buildings is frequently shared by social media accounts trafficking in shareable content. A representative example comes from the Twitter account Fascinating, which shared the video with the caption, \"A train in Singapore with windows that automatically blind when passing residential blocks\" on Dec. 12, 2022: This is an accurate description of the video's contents. Several clues allow a viewer to discern the precise metro system in which the video was filmed: Singapore's Bukit Panjang Light Rail Transit (LRT) system. That metro system's terminus is a station at Choa Chu Kang . This station's name is written on the window of the train in the viral video. Further, the Bukit Panjang LRT operates a \"Service A\" and \"Service B\" line, and one of its stops is \" Petir .\" Based on the LED message above the door, also in the above photograph, this is a Service B line headed toward Petir. According to Singapore's Land Transportation Authority (LTA), the Bukit Panjang LRT is Singapore's first light rail and is fully automated: The Bukit Panjang Light Rapid Transit (BPLRT) was launched as the first light rail line in Singapore in 1999. The fully automated 8km line connects residential estates within Bukit Panjang and Choa Chu Kang to the North-South and Downtown Lines, complementing existing feeder bus services. It is also the first driverless inter-town train feeder service. The Singapore LTA specifically mentions the privacy features of this train service, as well: To cater for the line's proximity to homes, the trains have special privacy features such as windows that automatically dim. In terms of specifics, it is likely that the train pictured in the video is a Bombardier INNOVIA APM 100 . According to the website SGTrains.com, \"These trains operate on an exclusive elevated guideway, unhampered by road and pedestrian traffic. Compared to the metal-wheeled [Medium Rail Transit] trains, these APM trains are fitted with rubber tyres and are relatively quiet during operations.\" These trains, according to SGTrains, \"are well-known over the Internet\" thanks to their \"smart misting glass windows\" used to \"protect the privacy of residents living adjacent to the LRT line.\" Because this train's self-blinding windows are well-documented and because the video is easy to geolocate, we rate this claim as \"True.\"",

Rating: False About this rating A long-running hoax warns readers not to allow contact from a particular person or group because dire consequences will result. The basic form of these hoax warnings is typically drawn from the following template: Do not {read / open / respond to / join} an {email / text message / friend request / } sent by {real name / email address / screen name}! If you do, {you / your computer / your Facebook account / everyone on your contact list / your children} will be in danger of falling victim to a {serial killer / computer virus / hacker / predator}. One recent example reads: Be careful: I got a message from you or it shown on your wall here.. Please tell all the contacts in your messenger list not to accept friendship request from Andrea Wilson . She is a hacker and has the system connected to your Facebook account. If one of your contacts accepts it, you will also be hacked, so make sure that all your friends know it. Thanks. Forwarded as received. Hold your finger down on the message. At the bottom in the middle it will say forward. Hit that then click on the names of those in your list and it will send to them THIS Is REAL Variants of these messages are circulated endlessly, with different names swapped in and out (see more examples below). Another warns of account \"cloning.\" Of course, it's not outside the realm of possibility that an email message or a link posted on Facebook might carry a virus payload which could infect your computer and allow it be controlled by a botnet , but virus warnings that correspond to the patterns detailed below can be safely dismissed as japes, while other, greater security issues should remain on our radar. Additional examples: Please tell all the contacts in your messenger list not to accept anything from Fabrizio Brambilla . He has a foto with a dog.

    "article_text": "Claim: In 1998, Sony released a camcorder that could \"see through people's clothes,\" then immediately recalled the 700,000 devices allegedly sold. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True It's true that in 1998, Sony released a camcorder with infrared night vision capabilies. Under certain circumstances, it appeared to be able to \"see through clothing\" — in the sense that the camera could detect the silhouette of a person's body underneath their clothing. Sony halted shipment of the cameras to modify the feature. What's False However, there is no evidence that Sony recalled hundreds of thousands of the camcorders because of this or announced that they were doing so. For years a rumor has circulated online that in 1998, Sony released a camcorder that could \"see through\" people's clothes. \"TIL that in 1998, Sony released a camcorder with night vision so powerful it could see through people's clothes. Sony immediately issued a recall,\" one 2020 Reddit post read. It redirected to an article published by Fossybytes in January 2016 with the title, \"When Sony Accidentally Launched Camcorders That Could 'See Through' People's Clothes.\" . Another Reddit post claimed , \"Sony has modified its NightShot camera, but didn't recall camcorders that were already on shelves,\" while an X (formerly Twitter) post said, \"In 1998, Sony's camcorders could see through clothes due to an infrared feature meant for night vision. This led to a massive recall, marking a significant event in tech history.\" Social media users shared the same rumor on platforms such as Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and TikTok , with one November 2023 post reaching over 1.3 million views. It's true that Sony released its \"NightShot\" camcorder, which, under certain circumstances (for instance, if the subjects wore very thin fabrics), and with a special filter, could detect and display the outlines of some people's bodies underneath their clothes. However, we found no evidence to confirm the claim that 700,000 of the camcorders were immediately recalled after the unintended feature was discovered by users. Instead, Sony announced it had halted shipment of remaining unsold devices until modifications could be made. We found several news articles from 1998 on the topic. For instance, in August 1998, The Washington Post published an article titled \"UNDRESSED IN A FLASH? CAMERA MAY TAKE REVEALING PORTRAITS.\" It informed that Sony halted shipment of its Handycam video cameras until modifications were made: This month, the Japanese electronics giant halted shipment of its Handycam video cameras until modifications are made, after a Japanese magazine revealed that the cameras' infrared \"Nightshot\" feature, intended to capture nighttime images such as sleeping babies and nocturnal animals, may have an unintended bonus under certain conditions during daylight hours: the ability to see through clothing. The modified models will not allow use of the function in daylight, but many original versions are still on the shelves at local stores. \"Under precise conditions, you'll think you'll see something but you won't,\" Steve Uhrig, president of SWS Security, a Maryland company that manufactures surveillance systems for government agencies, claimed in an interview with the Post, adding that \"infrared rays can penetrate through lightly woven clothing and reflect back, but not in real detail. You'll see something big and dense on the other side of the clothing. It's the same illusion as X-ray specs.\" The article continued (emphasis ours): Sony first discovered its product's potential when Takarajima, a popular Japanese men's magazine, reported in July that the camera, in conjunction with an inexpensive filter and specific circumstances -- such as a subject with tight, light clothing -- enables viewers to see underwear or peek under swimsuits when the Nightshot feature is activated. Sony officials cautiously acknowledge that there may be some truth to that. \"Engineers in Japan tried to replicate what was done in the news story,\" said Sony spokesperson Dulcie Neiman. \"In some very special circumstances -- depending on the daylight, the type of clothing, the texture, the color, the thickness, how much clothing is worn, the distance of the person to the camera -- that reported capability could be replicated.\" The New York Times published an article on the rumor in December 1998 in which it claimed that it \"had only the tiniest grain of truth: in skilled hands, during the day, under just the right conditions, with just the right (gauzy) fabrics, it might be possible to produce an image of a body beneath. The camera could not, of course, see through clothes, and there was no recall\": Sony was only slightly embarrassed; what the company had in mind with the No Lux feature, its news release said, was ''to record nighttime activities, such as a new baby sleeping.'' Though 400,000 units had been sold, Sony modified the infrared transmitters on new cameras to remove even the remotest possibility of intrusive videotaping. A CNN Money (currently known as CNN Business) article from August 1998 with the title \"Sony's naked cam scam?\" explained that the claim about the camcorder's ability to \"be used for filming more of their subjects than meets the eye\" seemed to be \"based more on titillation than substance.\" It underscored that Sony said the camera's night vision was offered for the purpose of photographing wildlife at night and other nocturnal scenes. It also said Sony confirmed that \"with a special lens, and very particular circumstances, its NightShot cameras appear to see through clothing\" (emphasis added). In bright sunlight, with that \"special\" lens, the infrared camera didn't reveal anything the naked eye couldn't see. \"It was nothing,\" said Steve McFradden, a B&H sales associate. \"It was intended to see in the dark, not see through clothes.\" CNN also reported that \"Sony has modified its NightShot camera, but has no plans to recall the roughly 400,000 units already shipped to the U.S\": Those 400,000 are the subject of increasing interest. \"I have spoken to a whole bunch of people and they didn't buy the camera for that reason,\" McFadden said. \"But they asked a lot of questions and were very curious about it.\" We found a video published by The Associated Press titled \"JAPAN: SONY VIDEO CAMERA TURNS OUT TO HAVE X-RAY VISION.\" Its description stated that \"the camera - with the aid of an inexpensive filter - can see through people's clothing,\" adding that Sony says it has stripped the special feature off new versions of the camera. The article informed that Sony found out about its product's potential from an article in \"Takarajima,\" Japan's biggest selling men's magazine: The magazine reported that a filter costing less than seven U-S dollars enables Handycam users to look beneath certain kinds of clothing during the daytime when the camera's \\\"night shot\\\" mode is activated. The article was accompanied by a dozen photos it said were taken with the camera using different colours of clothing, wet and dry, on women models. \"Sony won't be recalling any of the camcorders that are already on store shelves, spokeswoman Dolcy Nyman said,\" in an interview for WIRED. \"Any television station has the equipment that can duplicate this effect, as does anyone who has a professional camcorder,\" Beach Photo & Video's Herron, who specializes in surveillance and infrared video equipment, told WIRED. \"Any sheer blouse or clothing, if you hit it with enough light, you're gonna get a silhouette of what's underneath; and that's essentially all you get with these Sony camcorders.\" The article reported that Sony said it altered the NightShot feature so it couldn't be turned on when ambient light levels are high enough to make the feature unnecessary. \"The new cameras will only show a blank white screen when NightShot is enabled in daylight,\" it read. Phil Petescia, who worked as marketing manager at Sony for Handycam in 1998, reached out to us via email and confirmed that Sony did not recall the cameras: We did not recall the cameras. They could record through thin black clothing if the person was wearing white underwear (or had very light skin) under certain settings enhanced by an additional lens. I went to Macy's in Paramus and bought every black bathing suit they had and we tested it. We halted shipments while a rework was done, preventing that setting. However, we stopped a TV commercial we had recorded (still floating around on the internet) of someone sneaking up in the dark of a cat and dog amorously embracing. We felt it was a bit too risky. Breck Eisner, Michael's son, directed that commercial. In February 2024 we investigated a similar claim of whether full-body imaging machines used by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) show a person's private parts whenever they \"walk through the X-ray scanner.\"",

Sony halted shipment of the cameras to modify the feature. What's False However, there is no evidence that Sony recalled hundreds of thousands of the camcorders because of this or announced that they were doing so. In September 2025, a longstanding rumor resurfaced online, alleging that Sony recalled 700,000 camcorders in 1998 because they could \"see through\" people's clothing. For instance, a Sept. 14, 2025, Facebook post ( archived ) with the claim received over 18,000 reactions, reading: In 1998, Sony faced an unusual controversy when it accidentally released around 700,000 camcorders equipped with a feature that could see through clothing under certain conditions. The device, called the Sony Handycam CCD-TRV65, was designed with an infrared \"Night Vision\" function to help users record in low light or complete darkness. However, when used in daylight with an infrared filter, the camcorder could see through certain materials like swimsuits and thin fabrics, creating an effect that looked like X-ray vision. This unexpected capability caused a media storm. Privacy advocates and parents were alarmed, fearing misuse by people with bad intentions. What was supposed to be a clever marketing feature for nighttime recording suddenly turned into a potential scandal. Sony quickly recalled the camcorders and discontinued the feature to avoid further controversy. The incident remains a fascinating example of how technology can have unintended consequences. While Sony had no malicious intent, the camcorders sparked debates about surveillance, ethics, and consumer responsibility. Today, the story is often remembered as a quirky piece of tech history. an accident that blurred the line between innovation and invasion of privacy. It also serves as a reminder that even advanced tools can create risks if not carefully tested. The story has long circulated on Instagram and Facebook , as well as Reddit , Threads , X and TikTok . In short, the posts included elements of accurate and false information. It's true that, in 1998, Sony released its \"NightShot\" camcorder — which, under certain circumstances (for instance, if the subjects wore very thin fabrics) and with the use of a special filter, could detect and display the outlines of some people's bodies underneath their clothes.

    "claim": "Sony owns a patent for an interactive commercial system that allows viewers to skip commercials by yelling the brand name of the advertiser at their television or monitor. ",
    "rating": "True",
    "article_text": "Claim: Sony owns a patent for an interactive commercial system that allows viewers to skip commercials by yelling the brand name of the advertiser at their television or monitor. Rating: True About this rating Context Yelling \"McDonalds!\" to end a television commercial for the fast-food restaurant is just one example of many \"interactive commercials\" contained within this patent. On Jan. 9, 2023, a Twitter user tweeted that \"Sony owns a patent that would force viewers to exclaim the brand name during commercials [in order] to end them.\" The tweet, which went viral, was accompanied by a \" meme-worthy \" patent illustration: Snopes readers asked us if this was a genuine patent truly owned by Sony and if its purpose is accurately described in the viral tweet. In short, the answer to both questions is yes. More broadly, the patent — tracked down by TechRadar editor Lance Ulanoff — describes a \"system for converting television commercials into interactive networked video games.\" The verbal commercial-ender is just one of several advertising solutions outlined in the patent. The patent is, indeed, owned by Sony. The viral image comes from Figure 9 in this patent. The interpretation of the comic matches the technical notes for this figure: In [the] first capture of the sequence, a user is watching [a] movie. Progress pointer in progress bar shows that [the] content display corresponds to a movie and that [a] break is approaching. On second capture, progress pointer shows that the movie has progressed to break for placing the IC [Interactive Commercial]. IC is interactive and instructions from the display ask the user to 'Say \"McDonalds\" to end [the] commercial.' On third capture, the user is saying \"McDonalds!\" The client device includes a microphone that captures the user's words and voice recognition on the device [that] determines that the user has responded. The system then proceeds to skip the rest of the commercial, as shown on fourth capture, where the user goes back to watch the movie. What's the point? The patent provides one example of a motivation for both advertiser and viewer: In one embodiment, the user gets rewarded with some points or a coupon from the sponsor [for shouting out the brand]. The rewards can be collected by the user in a variety of ways, such as receiving a coupon in the mail or via email, getting a text message in a mobile phone with the coupon, collecting points toward collecting [prizes] in a web site, etc. This, it bears highlighting, is not the only McDonald's-based interactive commercial technology described in the Sony patent. Figure 8 describes a scenario in which a viewer could \"speed up\" a commercial by \"throwing a pickle\" into a burger: In the embodiment of FIG. 8, the instructions are \"Throw the pickle to speed up commercial.\" The user, which is holding a one-handed controller with motion detection, swings his arm to simulate the act of throwing a pickle. As a result, the flying interactive pickle is placed in the burger, and the commercial message \"Make it your way\" is displayed briefly before the commercial ends and the user returns to watching the streaming media. Because this is a genuine patent owned by Sony that describes a system for skipping commercials that involves yelling brand names out loud, the claim is \"True.\"",

Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True It's true that in 1998, Sony released a camcorder with infrared night vision capabilies. Under certain circumstances, it appeared to be able to \"see through clothing\" — in the sense that the camera could detect the silhouette of a person's body underneath their clothing. Sony halted shipment of the cameras to modify the feature. What's False However, there is no evidence that Sony recalled hundreds of thousands of the camcorders because of this or announced that they were doing so. For a long time, there has been an online rumor that Sony launched a camcorder in 1998 that could see through clothing. One viral 2020 Reddit post claimed that \"in 1998, Sony released a camcorder with night vision so powerful it could see through people's clothes. Sony immediately issued a recall.\" The post linked to a 2016 article published by Fossybytes titled, \"When Sony Accidentally Launched Camcorders That Could 'See Through' People's Clothes.\" Another Reddit post claimed , \"Sony has modified its NightShot camera, but didn't recall camcorders that were already on shelves,\" while an X (formerly Twitter) post said, \"In 1998, Sony's camcorders could see through clothes due to an infrared feature meant for night vision. This led to a massive recall, marking a significant event in tech history.\" Social media users shared the same rumor on platforms such as Instagram , Facebook , YouTube and TikTok , with one November 2023 post reaching more than 1.3 million views. It's true that Sony released its \"NightShot\" camcorder, which, under certain circumstances (for instance, if the subjects wore very thin fabrics), and with a special filter, could detect and display the outlines of some people's bodies underneath their clothes. However, we found no evidence to confirm the claim that 700,000 of the camcorders were immediately recalled after the unintended feature was discovered by users. Instead, Sony announced it had halted shipment of remaining unsold devices until modifications could be made. We found several news articles from 1998 on the topic. For instance, in August 1998, The Washington Post published an article titled \"UNDRESSED IN A FLASH? CAMERA MAY TAKE REVEALING PORTRAITS.\" It informed that Sony halted shipment of its Handycam video cameras until modifications were made: This month, the Japanese electronics giant halted shipment of its Handycam video cameras until modifications are made, after a Japanese magazine revealed that the cameras' infrared \"Nightshot\" feature, intended to capture nighttime images such as sleeping babies and nocturnal animals, may have an unintended bonus under certain conditions during daylight hours: the ability to see through clothing. The modified models will not allow use of the function in daylight, but many original versions are still on the shelves at local stores. \"Under precise conditions, you'll think you'll see something but you won't,\" Steve Uhrig, president of SWS Security, a Maryland company that manufactures surveillance systems for government agencies, said in an interview with the Post, adding that \"infrared rays can penetrate through lightly woven clothing and reflect back, but not in real detail. You'll see something big and dense on the other side of the clothing. It's the same illusion as X-ray specs.\" The article continued (emphasis ours): Sony first discovered its product's potential when Takarajima, a popular Japanese men's magazine, reported in July that the camera, in conjunction with an inexpensive filter and specific circumstances -- such as a subject with tight, light clothing -- enables viewers to see underwear or peek under swimsuits when the Nightshot feature is activated. Sony officials cautiously acknowledge that there may be some truth to that. \"Engineers in Japan tried to replicate what was done in the news story,\" said Sony spokesperson Dulcie Neiman. \"In some very special circumstances -- depending on the daylight, the type of clothing, the texture, the color, the thickness, how much clothing is worn, the distance of the person to the camera -- that reported capability could be replicated.\" The New York Times published an article on the rumor in December 1998 in which it claimed that it \"had only the tiniest grain of truth: in skilled hands, during the day, under just the right conditions, with just the right (gauzy) fabrics, it might be possible to produce an image of a body beneath. The camera could not, of course, see through clothes, and there was no recall\": Sony was only slightly embarrassed; what the company had in mind with the No Lux feature, its news release said, was ''to record nighttime activities, such as a new baby sleeping.'' Though 400,000 units had been sold, Sony modified the infrared transmitters on new cameras to remove even the remotest possibility of intrusive videotaping. A CNN Money article from August 1998 with the title \"Sony's naked cam scam?\" explained that the claim about the camcorder's ability to \"be used for filming more of their subjects than meets the eye\" seemed to be \"based more on titillation than substance.\" It underscored that Sony said the camera's night vision was offered for the purpose of photographing wildlife at night and other nocturnal scenes. It also said Sony confirmed that \"with a special lens, and very particular circumstances, its NightShot cameras appear to see through clothing\": In bright sunlight, with that \"special\" lens, the infrared camera didn't reveal anything the naked eye couldn't see. \"It was nothing,\" said Steve McFradden, a B&H sales associate. \"It was intended to see in the dark, not see through clothes.\" CNN also reported that \"Sony has modified its NightShot camera, but has no plans to recall the roughly 400,000 units already shipped to the U.S\": Those 400,000 are the subject of increasing interest. \"I have spoken to a whole bunch of people and they didn't buy the camera for that reason,\" McFadden said. \"But they asked a lot of questions and were very curious about it.\" We found a video published by The Associated Press titled \"JAPAN: SONY VIDEO CAMERA TURNS OUT TO HAVE X-RAY VISION.\" Its description stated that \"the camera - with the aid of an inexpensive filter - can see through people's clothing,\" adding that Sony says it has stripped the special feature off new versions of the camera. The article informed that Sony found out about its product's potential from an article in Takarajima, Japan's biggest selling men's magazine: The magazine reported that a filter costing less than seven U-S dollars enables Handycam users to look beneath certain kinds of clothing during the daytime when the camera's \\\"night shot\\\" mode is activated. The article was accompanied by a dozen photos it said were taken with the camera using different colours of clothing, wet and dry, on women models. Sony had no plans to recall camcorders, spokeswoman Dolcy Nyman said in an interview with Wired. \"Any television station has the equipment that can duplicate this effect, as does anyone who has a professional camcorder,\" Randall Herron, a photography equipment salesman who specialized in surveillance and infrared video equipment, told Wired. \"Any sheer blouse or clothing, if you hit it with enough light, you're gonna get a silhouette of what's underneath; and that's essentially all you get with these Sony camcorders.\" The article reported that Sony said it altered the NightShot feature so it couldn't be turned on when ambient light levels are high enough to make the feature unnecessary. \"The new cameras will only show a blank white screen when NightShot is enabled in daylight,\" it reported. Phil Petescia, who worked as marketing manager at Sony for Handycam in 1998, reached out to us via email and confirmed that Sony did not recall the cameras: We did not recall the cameras. They could record through thin black clothing if the person was wearing white underwear (or had very light skin) under certain settings enhanced by an additional lens. I went to Macy's in Paramus and bought every black bathing suit they had and we tested it. We halted shipments while a rework was done, preventing that setting. However, we stopped a TV commercial we had recorded (still floating around on the internet) of someone sneaking up in the dark of a cat and dog amorously embracing. We felt it was a bit too risky. Breck Eisner, Michael's son, directed that commercial. In February 2024 we investigated a similar claim of whether full-body imaging machines used by the Transportation Security Administration show a person's private parts whenever they walk through a scanner.",

Rating: True About this rating On Sept. 6, 2024, a video was shared to X purportedly showing a body armor company demonstrating its \"stab protection\" vest on the organization's CEO. In the footage, the alleged CEO wore one of the company's vests while another individual repeatedly attempted to stab him with a knife. The person delivering the strikes used significant force, aiming directly at the man's torso, but the vest appeared to successfully prevent any injuries. Throughout the demonstration, the person being stabbed remained calm.

    "article_text": "Claim: In 2014, physicist Stephen Hawking warned that development of artificial intelligence (AI) could mean the \"end of the human race.\" Rating: Correct Attribution About this rating On May 1, 2023, the New York Post ran a story saying that British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking had warned that the development of artificial intelligence (AI) could mean \"the end of the human race.\" Hawking, who died in 2018, had indeed said so in an interview with the BBC in 2014. \"The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race,\" Hawking said during the interview. \"Once humans develop artificial intelligence, it would take off on its own and re-design itself at an ever-increasing rate.\" Another story , from CNBC in 2017, relayed a similar warning about AI from the physicist. It came from Hawking's speech at the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon, Portugal, according to CNBC. Hawking reportedly said: Unless we learn how to prepare for, and avoid, the potential risks, AI could be the worst event in the history of our civilization. It brings dangers, like powerful autonomous weapons, or new ways for the few to oppress the many. It could bring great disruption to our economy. Such warnings became more common in 2023. In March, tech leaders, scientists, and entrepreneurs warned about the dangers posed by AI creations, like ChatGPT, to humanity. \"AI systems with human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity, as shown by extensive research and acknowledged by top AI labs,\" they wrote in an open letter published by the Future of Life Institute, a nonprofit. The letter garnered over 27,500 signatures as of this writing in early May 2023. Among the signatories were CEO of SpaceX, Tesla, and Twitter Elon Musk, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, and Pinterest co-founder Evan Sharp. In addition, Snopes and other fact-checking organizations noted a dramatic uptick in misinformation conveyed on social media via AI-generated content in 2022 and 2023. Then, on May 2, long-time researcher at Google, Geoffrey Hinton, quit the technology behemoth to sound the alarm about AI products. Hinton, known as \"Godfather of AI,\" told MIT Technology Review that chatbots like GPT-4 – that OpenAI, an AI lab – \"are on track to be a lot smarter than he thought they'd be.\" Given that Hawking was indeed documented as warning about the potential for AI to \"spell the end of the human race,\" we rate this quote as correctly attributed to him.",

What's False However, Wozniak does not print the bills himself, which would be a federal crime. For years, a rumor has circulated online that Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak prints his own $2 bills and uses them as legal tender. ELI5: How does Steve Wozniak print his own legal US $2 bills. by u/tophmctoph in explainlikeimfive \"Steve Wozniak, the Apple co-founder, is known for printing his own unique currency — $2 bills that he personally designs,\" claimed one Instagram post, accompanied by a video purportedly showing Wozniak discussing the practice. The claim also spread on social media platforms including Pinterest and YouTube . The video is authentic and originated from an episode of \" The Engadget Show \" titled \"Woz's $2 bill sheets.\" In the interview, Wozniak says: Yeah, basically I got a printer in my hometown of Los Gatos, California, to make these pads for me. I got them the supplies from a higher-quality printer, and they're perforated so you can tear them off like Green Stamps. I don't know if it's the right president. The serial numbers are very suspicious, but you can still smell the ink. So don't touch it because it's a little wet. He added: \"They meet the specs of the U.S. government, so by law, these are legal tender. I have been spending them. You can get arrested for them, you cannot get convicted because you're in the right.\" In short, the claim that Wozniak prints his own $2 bills is false, despite his frequent recounting of this anecdote, sometimes trolling audiences with tongue-in-cheek comments about the ink still being wet, etc. Making counterfeit money is a serious federal crime. Buying sheets of uncut $2 bills directly from the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing and making pads out of them is not, however. We reached out to Wozniak for comment and will update this article if he responds. In an archived post on Wozniak's official website , he shared the truth behind the story in response to an email inquiry. The email read: \"Reading through the letters section, I saw a reference to a Secret Service interrogation, but nowhere else on your site could I find a description of the incident. Would you mind relating it again (or giving me a pointer to where the story resides)?\" \"I have tons of $2 bill stories that will make a whole chapter in my book someday. My $2 bills are real and legit but unusual,\" Wozniak wrote, explaining: You can purchase $1, $2, and now $5 bills from the Bureau of Printing and Engraving on sheets. The sheets come in sizes of 4, 16, and 32 bills each. I buy such sheets of $2 bills. I carry large sheets, folded in my pocket, and sometimes pull out scissors and cut a few off to pay for something in a store. It's just for comedy, as the $2 bills cost nearly $3 each when purchased on sheets. They cost even more at coin stores. \"I take the sheets of 4 bills and have a printer, located through friends, gum them into pads, like stationery pads. The printer then perforates them between the bills, so that I can tear a bill or two away,\" he added, admitting that the bills are not self-produced but are legitimate currency purchased from the U.S. government. For those interested, the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing offers uncut currency sheets for purchase on its official website. We have previously investigated other claims involving dollar bills. For instance, in 2022 we fact-checked a rumor that picking up folded dollar bills from the ground could be life-threatening because of the presence of powder inside containing fentanyl and methamphetamine.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Suzuki has launched to market a $3,000 transport robot dog called MOQBA. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True Suzuki has proposed a robotic mobility concept called MOQBA (Modular Quad Based Architecture), which was unveiled at the Japan Mobility Show in 2023. It is designed to assist people facing transportation barriers, and the concept envisions a modular robot capable of climbing stairs and navigating difficult terrain. What's False However, the robot has not been released to market, nor has Suzuki announced a commercial launch date or a $3,000 price tag. An image circulating on social media — which shows a man riding a robotic dog — alongside the claim is not an actual photograph of the MOQBA prototype and is likely AI-generated. Since at least early May 2025, a claim has circulated online that motor vehicle and mobility manufacturer Suzuki has launched to market a $3,000 transport robot dog. For example, one YouTube video featuring the claim was titled: \"Suzuki Unveils a $3000 Transport Robot Dog That Just Hit the Market!\" The description read: Robot dogs are no longer just a concept—they're here, ready to transport people across the city. Suzuki has stunned the world of transportation with a new platform that adapts and transforms, redefining urban mobility. The footage had amassed more than 58,000 views as of this writing. The claim also appeared in various forms on LinkedIn , Instagram and Facebook . The latter two posts included an image of a man riding a large robotic dog, as shown below. (bingitty / Instagram) But the claim that Suzuki had released a $3,000 transport robot dog is a mixture of true and false information. The robot in question — called MOQBA, which is short for Modular Quad Based Architecture — is actually a concept prototype, not a product available for sale. The Japanese manufacturer first revealed it at the Japan Mobility Show in October 2023, where it was presented as a \" proposal for next-generation mobility .\" According to the company's press release for the 2023 Japan show, MOQBA would assist people who face transportation barriers, such as stairs. The robot would be designed to \"move smoothly with wheels on flat roads, and seamlessly move on steps with legs.\" Features would include modular attachments with three modes — chair, standing and stretcher — to help transport people and goods in places where cars cannot reach, including in emergency situations. The press release made no mention of commercialization or pricing. A Reuters video from the event in 2023 featured MOQBA at the 00:34 mark, confirming its conceptual nature. A 2023 article by Designboom, a daily web magazine that covers industrial design, described it as a prototype that still requires additional research and development. Neither the press release nor the video — nor any reporting from established automotive or tech outlets — mention any retail launch or pricing. Additionally, the image featured in the Instagram and Facebook posts — showing a man riding what appears to be a large robotic dog — is likely AI-generated. Hive Moderation's detection tool flagged the image as \"likely to contain AI-generated or deepfake content\" with a 97.9% confidence score. Sightengine similarly determined with 99% certainty that it was \"likely AI-generated.\" As of June 2025, Suzuki has not publicly commented on the claim that it is developing or releasing a $3,000 transport robot dog. Snopes has contacted the company's press office to verify whether such a product is in development. We will update this story if we receive a response.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Some experimental garbage cans in Malmö, Sweden, play racy audio messages whenever someone opens them to throw trash in, as part of an effort to discourage littering. Rating: True About this rating Fact Check A couple of garbage cans in the Swedish city of Malmö are indulging in dirty talk via audio of sexy moans and statements that play each time someone opens them to toss trash in. This is part of a real initiative by the city roads department to discourage littering. In this clip of the garbage cans by Richard Orange, an editor for European news site The Local — also shared by AFP — one can hear the sexy talk in Swedish: The rubbish bins express arousal each time someone opens them, with statements like “hmm, yeah,” “that was crazy good,” and “just to the left.” According to The Local , the talking bins are located on the Davidshallsbron bridge, across from a pedestrian shopping street. The city purchased 18 such trash cans back in 2017, but currently only two of them talk, and this is reportedly the first time they’ve been given a sexy voice. According to Marie Persson , section chief at the city’s roads department, “The sentences are part of the campaign’s intention to get more people to talk about the dirtiest thing there is: littering. The stuff that ends up in our streets, squares, and sea [...] So please go ahead and feed the bins with more rubbish…yes, just like that.” Persson also told the Swedish paper Sydsvenskan that the sexy voice belongs to “a famous person” who wants to remain anonymous.",

    "rating": "True",
    "article_text": "Claim: Twitter permits accounts claiming affiliation with the Taliban to operate on its platform, even though former U.S. President Donald Trump is still banned from the platform. Rating: True About this rating Context Twitter did not respond to questions about why it was allowing specific accounts claiming to be Taliban-affiliated to operate on the platform, but has argued that it would enforce policies that prohibit the “glorification of violence,” “hateful conduct,” and more. As the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in mid-August 2021, numerous accounts claiming to be affiliated with the organization posted updates on Twitter. Given that Taliban-affiliated accounts have long been banned from Facebook and YouTube, many online criticized Twitter for banning former U.S. President Donald Trump but not these accounts. Trump had been banned from the social media platform since January 2021 due to “the risk of further incitement of violence” during the riots on Capitol Hill. One particular account , claiming to be the “Official Twitter Account of the Spokesman of Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, Zabihullah Mujahid” (referring to the unrecognized Taliban-run state), has more than 337,000 followers and has been posting updates saying it wants good trade and diplomatic relations with other countries, and announced the Taliban’s first news conference in August. Another account claiming to be associated with Suhail Shaheen, a Taliban spokesman for international media in Qatar, has been posting tweets assuring diplomats, workers for charities, and consulate employees that “a secure environment would be provided for them.” We reached out to Twitter, but it did not respond to our queries about the reasoning behind the continued functioning of the above accounts. According to a Twitter spokesperson: The situation in Afghanistan is rapidly evolving. We're also witnessing people in the country using Twitter to seek help and assistance. Twitter’s top priority is keeping people safe, and we remain vigilant. We are taking steps to safeguard the voices of those on our service who represent protected groups including, humanitarian workers, journalists, news media organisations, human rights activists, and others. Our strong and dedicated teams are providing 24/7 global coverage to proactively enforce our rules at scale and swiftly actioning content that violates the Twitter Rules , specifically policies prohibiting glorification of violence , abusive behaviour , hateful conduct , wishes of harm, and gratuitous gore . We have prioritized labeling Tweets to provide context to people on the service who may be seeing examples of misleading or deceptive content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy. Our enforcement approach is agile and we will remain transparent about our work as it continues to evolve to address these increasingly complex issues. In sum, Twitter appears to have allowed the Taliban-affiliated accounts to remain online for now, but says it will enforce policies that prohibit the \"glorification of violence, abusive behaviour\" and more. Facebook had, however, officially banned the Taliban from operating on its pages, even though affiliated or supportive accounts keep popping up. It is true that Trump is still banned on the platform for violating the above policies. Presently, according to a New York Time s report, various accounts claiming to be connected to the Taliban have largely shared information that does not glorify or espouse violence and hate speech. Even a new Twitter account claiming to be the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan” that posted videos of purported Taliban military maneuvers did not feature graphic, violent imagery. This appears to be part of a sophisticated pattern of propaganda to convince the world that the Taliban has evolved into a softer organization. But reports on the ground, involving Taliban violently dispersing protests and stopping women news anchors from appearing on state television, suggest otherwise. We thus rate this claim as “True.” We will update this post if Twitter or other social media platforms change their approach on this evolving story.",

    "article_text": "Claim: On Jan. 7, 2023, Elon Musk deleted a Twitter thread from his personal account about how safe Tesla cars are. Rating: False About this rating Context Musk indeed tweeted a thread about \"how safe Tesla cars are\" on that date, though it was not the beginning of a self-authored thread that he later deleted. It was a quote retweet of a thread from Tesla's company Twitter account. There is no evidence that either account deleted the thread. On March 21, 2023, an image spread on Twitter and Reddit that claimed to show evidence that Tesla and Twitter CEO Elon Musk tweeted and then deleted a thread consisting of tweets about how safe Tesla cars are. Though he indeed tweeted (or retweeted, more accurately) such a thread on that date, it is not true that he deleted it. The image supposedly depicted a tweet by Musk — \"Thread on how safe Tesla cars are\" — followed by at least four tweets marked \"unavailable\" that he had supposedly deleted. User @SaeedDiCaprio captioned the image , \"still can't believe this happened,\" adding in a reply, \"I really have the most perfectly timed screenshot of all time.\" \"This tweet is unavailable\" is an error message that typically appears when a tweet has been deleted by the original poster. Musk indeed tweeted a \"Thread on how safe Tesla cars are\" on Jan. 7, 2023, like the screenshot claimed. However, that tweet was not the beginning of a self-authored thread that he later deleted. It was a quote retweet sharing a thread from Tesla's official company Twitter account. We came to that conclusion by checking Musk's Twitter account and finding a post with a date that matched that in the screenshot: Jan. 7, 2023. We saw it was a quote retweet of a thread originally posted by Tesla. Using PolitiTweet , a database of public figures' deleted tweets, we confirmed no tweets were deleted after the initial post. Thread on how safe Tesla cars are https://t.co/M3Hf3q4kh3 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 7, 2023 Using direct messaging, we reached out to @SaeedDiCaprio to learn the screenshot's origin story. He said he did not create it using digital-editing software, and that it was an authentic depiction of a moment in time on Twitter. \"[The] screenshot is real!\" @SaeedDiCaprio wrote. It's possible that the screenshot documented a technical mishap. Twitter has previously suffered glitches wherein users were unable to see images or use links within tweets. Users on the platform have wondered if their tweets have been deleted by the platform in such cases. When we reached out to Twitter to ask whether the screenshot depicted a technical glitch with Musk's Jan. 7 post, we received a poop emoji automated response , which Musk had announced on March 19 was the Twitter press team's new autoreply. We'll update this fact check if we hear anything more substantive from Twitter. If you're unsure about whether a claimed post from a public figure is real, one quick way to verify is to go to their social media profile and try to find what they posted at the alleged date and time. Chances are, you'll be able to either confirm the post is real, or find the real post behind the fake claim.",

    "article_text": "Claim: In September 2025, electric car manufacturer Tesla announced the $789 \"Pi Phone,\" which comes with a free connection to satellite internet through SpaceX's Starlink. Rating: False About this rating Context Tesla CEO Elon Musk has occasionally suggested that the company might produce a mobile phone, but Tesla has never announced such a product. A rumor circulated online in September 2025 claiming that the electric car manufacturer Tesla had announced the \"Pi Phone,\" a mobile phone with free satellite internet connection through SpaceX's Starlink service. According to the posts, Tesla CEO Elon Musk had announced the phone, supposedly priced at $789, by saying \"Apple should be worried.\" For example, on Sept. 23, the Facebook page Trend Fuel posted ( archived ) the story, receiving more than 170,000 likes. The post displayed a picture of Musk holding up the supposed phone. The post began, \"It's official. The $789 Tesla Pi Phone just changed the entire smartphone game and it's not just hype.\" Snopes readers emailed us to ask whether the rumor was true. We reached out to Tesla as part of reporting this story but have not heard back. Other Facebook users and YouTube channels also shared the same claim. Some of those posts featured links in top comments leading to articles hosted by WordPress blogs . However, searches of Bing , DuckDuckGo , Google and Yahoo found no credible news media outlets reporting about a Tesla phone. Prominent news media outlets would have widely reported this rumor, if true, and Tesla or Musk would have publicly announced the phone on their social media profiles. That had not happened. Rather, the person or people who authored the story fabricated the entire tale. Several posts sharing the claim likely aimed to earn advertising revenue on websites linked from the aforementioned Facebook posts. This is not the first time rumors of a Tesla phone have spread across the internet — Snopes previously fact-checked a similar claim in June 2024 . The rumor likely spreads because Musk has previously suggested in social media posts that his companies might investigate producing mobile phones at some point in the future.",

    "claim": "Texas has its own state-run power grid.",
    "rating": "True",
    "article_text": "Claim: Texas has its own state-run power grid. Rating: True About this rating Context It is true that Texas runs and is supplied by its own power grid known as the Texas Interconnection (TIS). It should be noted that parts of the state aren't tied into the grid. TIS also has the capability of tying into other power grids in some locations, as was the case when the state imported power from Mexico in 2011. Fact Check The Lone Star state is home to its very own state-regulated power grid known as the Texas Interconnection. The question of whether Texas produces its own power is one that the Snopes team has seen time and again. We often see this trend during times of power crisis, as was the case in 2021, when the state's power grid failed , or when energy politics and prices are making the headlines. This was the case in June 2022 when U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican representing Texas, tweeted that the \"impact of President Biden being beholden to the Green New Deal radicals in his party has electricity costs through the roof in Texas.\" Yes, it is true that Texas has its own power grid. The Texas Interconnection (TIS) is one of five alternating current (AC) power grids known in north America as interconnections, according to the U.S. Office of Electricity . TIS spans most of the state and covers all of the electric utilities maintained under the system, each of which is electrically tied together and operates at a \"synchronized frequency\" of a 60-hertz average during normal system conditions. The U.S. power grid is made up of two major and three minor power grids known as interconnections: The eastern and western interconnections are the largest, followed by the Texas, Quebec and Alaska interconnections. Several smaller interconnections are housed within these larger entities. Public Domain Texas' ownership over its power grid is not necessarily for technical reasons, but more for political ones, reported the Texas Tribune in 2011: namely, to avoid the feds. Power grids that cross state lines are managed by the U.S. Department of Energy, which is responsible for the national energy program, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates the sale and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. But because TIS does not cross state lines, the system can avoid regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and is instead managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ( ERCOT ). Some 26 million Texans and 90% of the electrical load rely on over 52,700 miles of transmission lines contained within the TIS. As a nonprofit, ERCOT is subject to oversight by the Public Utility Commission of Texas and the Texas Legislature. It's no secret that Texas is rich in energy. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that Texas produces more electricity than any other state, and nearly twice as much as Florida, which comes in at second place. Energy rates are typically determined by a combination of fuel costs, power plant availability, variations in demand, and availability of generation sources, notes the U.S. Energy Information Administration . This cost varies from minute to minute, and in hot climates like Texas, prices are highest in the summer when total demand for air conditioning increases. In the Lone Star State, those prices are set by ERCOT. To understand the history of ERCOT, we should also take a quick look back at the U.S. power grid through the 20th century. In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Federal Power Act, which gave the Federal Power Commission the power to oversee interstate electricity sales. But Texas wanted to remain out of federal oversight, particularly as its grid did not cross state lines. The establishment of TIS can trace its history back to World War II, when 10 independent power grids across the state connected to send excess power to the coast for manufacturing, according to ERCOT . Similarly, utility companies across the nation began to tie themselves together to be more productive, organized, and responsive both in the event of an emergency and to more efficiently manufacture and export goods to troops overseas. Following a blackout on Nov. 9, 1965, when 30 million people in the Northeastern U.S. lost power, legislators created the National Electric Reliability Council, now known as the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC). Five years later, ERCOT was founded to manage the Texas grid in accordance with national standards but still out of the way of federal fingers. (For more ERCOT history, see this explainer published by NBC Austin affiliate KXAN.) We should also note that the Texas power supply is neither totally independent nor does it cover the entire state. El Paso is on its own grid, as are parts of northeastern and southeastern Texas. In 2011 following rolling blackouts, Texas also imported some power from Mexico, as well as two ties to the Eastern U.S. grid.) Sources Archive.Ph. https://archive.ph/oiee1. Accessed 7 June 2022.

    "claim": "In May 2022, the state of Texas banned the use of filters on Instagram.",
    "rating": "Mostly False",
    "article_text": "Claim: In May 2022, the state of Texas banned the use of filters on Instagram. Rating: Mostly False About this rating What's True Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, disabled certain \"augmented reality\" effects and filters for Instagram and Facebook users in Texas and Illinois, in response to major lawsuits in those states over its use of facial recognition tools. However ... What's False Meta itself voluntarily chose to disable those features. Neither Texas nor Illinois banned them. Fact Check In May 2022, various social media users and news outlets reported that the state of Texas had banned the use of certain \"augmented reality\" filters popular on the photo-sharing app Instagram. For example, on May 11 @ThatBoyJorddynnn posted a widely shared tweet that stated, simply: \"Texas really just banned IG filters off Instagram...\" Several other widely shared social media posts made similar claims that Texas had banned Instagram filters. Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, did disable certain \"augmented reality\" effects and filters, for Instagram and Facebook users in Texas and Illinois, in response to major lawsuits in those states over its use of facial recognition tools. However, Meta itself voluntarily chose to disable those features. Neither Texas nor Illinois banned them. As a result, we are issuing a rating of \"Mostly False.\" The full background to those recent developments has been quite protracted and complicated, so the following is a very rough summary of the key events. 2008: Lawmakers in Illinois passed the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). Among other provisions, it prohibits anyone from collecting, buying, or selling the biometric information of others without their knowledge and consent. 2009: Lawmakers in Texas similarly passed the Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act (CUBI). It too prohibited any actor from capturing the biometric information of another, for commercial purposes, without first obtaining informed consent. 2010: Facebook announced it had begun using facial recognition software, originally in the context of photo tagging and \" tag suggestions .\" 2015: A small group of Illinois residents sued Facebook in what became a class-action lawsuit, alleging the company had breached their privacy rights, in violation of BIPA, by gathering and keeping digital scans of their faces, without their knowledge or consent. 2018: Facebook agreed to settle the lawsuit. February 2021: The settlement was finalized, with Facebook agreeing to pay $650 million to somewhere between 7 and 9 million recipients. November 2021: Facebook announced it would be shutting down its facial recognition program. On Feb. 14, 2022, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Facebook, now known as Meta Platforms, accusing the company of large-scale violations of CUBI, via its facial recognition program. Paxton wrote : For over a decade, while holding itself out as a trusted meeting place for Texans to connect and share special moments with family and friends, Facebook was secretly capturing, disclosing, unlawfully retaining — and profiting off of — Texans' most personal and highly sensitive information: records of their facial geometries, which Texas law refers to as biometric identifiers. Paxton has asked a court in Harrison County to put Meta on trial, order the company not to use facial recognition on its apps, delete existing data gathered from facial recognition programs, and pay $25,000 for each violation of CUBI — damages that could amount to billions of dollars if ordered. Meta has rejected those allegations , claimed CUBI itself is unconstitutional, and asked the court to throw out Paxton's lawsuit. However, the company has also said it would be temporarily disabling certain \"augmented reality\" (AR) features on Instagram and Facebook for users in Texas and Illinois. Those features include certain filters, effects, and masks. In a statement , Meta said: The technology we use to power augmented reality effects like masks, avatars, and filters is not facial recognition or any technology covered by the Texas and Illinois laws, and is not used to identify anyone. Nevertheless, we are taking this step to prevent meritless and distracting litigation under laws in these two states based on a mischaracterization of how our features work. Paxton's lawsuit against Meta did not cite these AR features as instances of the company's alleged privacy violations, and the company itself insists those features bear no relation to the Texas and Illinois biometrics laws in question. Therefore, while Meta's decision to temporarily disable those features for users in those states came in response to the major lawsuits, it is reasonable to say that it was not taken on pain of penalty. That is, Meta itself chose — more or less freely — to disable those features, so the claim that \"Texas banned Instagram filters\" is really not accurate. Hence our rating of \"Mostly False.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: A comic first published in 1919 predicted cell phones. Rating: True About this rating On March 5, 1919, the British tabloid The Mirror published a comic strip titled, \"The Pocket Telephone: When Will It Ring.\" The answer to that question was, according to the illustration, essentially all the time: A Snopes reader asked us to confirm the comic's authenticity; it was truly a creative work from 1919. According to the British Cartoon Archive, the comic was created by W. K. Haselden and first published in The Mirror on March 5, 1919. It was subsequently republished on Jan., 23, 1923, with the caption, \"When we all have pocket telephones.\" For those reasons, we rated this claim \"True.\" The comic was seemingly a response to a claim by the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company — an early player in long-distance wireless communication — that it was not far off from the realization of a pocket-sized wireless phone, as described in a widely syndicated March 1919 wire report : London, March 2 — Experiments in a new type of wireless telephone are so far advanced that it is proposed within a few weeks it will be possible to speak between London and New York. While the establishment of a regular commercial service by wireless telephone between London and New York early next year is expected by the Marconi company, according to a statement by Godfrey C. Isaacs, managing director of the company, to a correspondent of the Daily Mail. An early realization of pocket wireless telephone is also foreshadowed by Mr. Isaacs, who says that experiments have led him to believe that the pocket wireless will be in everyday use at no distant date.

    "claim": "Social media app TikTok can monitor keystrokes or taps made by a user.",
    "rating": "Mixture",
    "article_text": "Claim: Social media app TikTok can monitor keystrokes or taps made by a user. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True The research on which this claim is based shows that TikTok tracks inputs made while a person uses the app's built-in web browser on Apple's iOS, which TikTok does not allow users to disable. The company's privacy policy says \"keystroke patterns or rhythms\" are \"automatically collected information,\" which users cannot opt-out from providing. However ... What's False ... TikTok said collecting \"keystroke patterns or rhythms\" is \"fundamentally\" different from collecting the actual content of what a user types. The company claims this data refers to the timing of when keys are pressed and not the specific keys that are pressed. What's Undetermined It is unknown what TikTok does with the information collected, but the company claims it is for \"performance related purposes, such as to verify the authenticity of an account, for risk control, debugging, troubleshooting, and monitoring for proper performance.\" The Chinese-founded social media platform TikTok has been the target of the U.S. government over national-security concerns, with U.S. President Joe Biden signing a bill in April 2024 that bans the app unless its owner, ByteDance, sells it. Privacy concerns on the internet are nothing new, but claims have circulated online since 2022 that TikTok is able to track all of its users' keystrokes and inputs. As one Reddit user put it , \"I thought this was common knowledge. Unless people thought it was a conspiracy. In which case wow.\" (user CyberMasterV on Reddit) According to TikTok's privacy policy , which users must agree to before using the app, TikTok does collect some keystroke data, though the technical details are not as specific as the claim implies. While it's unknown what exactly the company does with this information, under the heading \"Automatically Collected Information,\" the policy reads, in part: We collect certain information about the device you use to access the Platform, such as your IP address, user agent, mobile carrier, time zone settings, identifiers for advertising purposes, model of your device, the device system, network type, device IDs, your screen resolution and operating system, app and file names and types, keystroke patterns or rhythms, battery state, audio settings and connected audio devices. A spokesperson for TikTok told Snopes that \"keystroke patterns or rhythms\" is \"fundamentally\" different from tracking the specifics of what a user types. The spokesperson said this data does not include which keys are actually pressed, just the timing of when they're pressed. The person also confirmed to Snopes there is no way for a user to opt out of providing this data. The statement read: \"TikTok collects certain keystroke patterns or rhythms for security and performance related purposes, such as to verify the authenticity of an account, for risk control, debugging, troubleshooting, and monitoring for proper performance.\" A representative directed us to a post on the TikTok website detailing the privacy policy in further detail, including a section on \"keystrokes,\" which repeats the statement above and adds: Prior to September 2022, when people used TikTok's in-app browser to browse a third party website, TikTok did not track which keys were pressed, only the fact that a key was pressed (a \"key event\") on a third-party website. Similarly, TikTok did not track which buttons were clicked on a third-party website, only the fact that a click had occurred (a \"click event\"), except in limited error scenarios. Moreover, starting in September 2022 for users using a current version of the App, no key events or click events were logged except when the IAB was used to view a TikTok-owned website. The claim first surfaced when self-described \"security and privacy researcher\" Felix Krause published a report on his blog in August 2022 alleging that TikTok was able to track its users' keystroke inputs in the platform's in-app web browser. The claim was then reported on by outlets such as The New York Times , The Guardian and Forbes . Krause wrote, \"When you open any link on the TikTok iOS app, it's opened inside their in-app browser. While you are interacting with the website, TikTok subscribes to all keyboard inputs (including passwords, credit card information, etc.) and every tap on the screen, like which buttons and links you click.\" Snopes could not independently verify Krause's findings. When opening a website from within the TikTok iOS app, they inject code that can observe every keyboard input (which may include credit card details, passwords or other sensitive information) TikTok also has code to observe all taps, like clicking on any buttons or links. pic.twitter.com/Dcv0N4ccKD — Felix Krause (@KrauseFx) August 18, 2022 The report followed up on a previous post Krause made about other social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, which also track users' inputs when using an in-app browser. However, of these platforms, TikTok is the only one that does not allow users the option to use an external browser for increased security. Krause created a website, inappbrowser.com , that can detect the code being used when opened within a social media app's web browser. Though the code is highly technical, Krause also provides a more rudimentary explanation through a Frequently Asked Questions section on his website . For example: Can in-app browsers read everything I do online? Yes, if you are browsing through their in-app browser they technically can. Are companies doing this on purpose? Building your own in-app browser takes a non-trivial time to program and maintain, significantly more than just using the privacy and user-friendly alternative that's already been built into the iPhone for the past 7 years. Most likely there is some motivation there for the company to track your activities on those websites. I opened InAppBrowser.com inside an app, and it doesn't show any commands. Am I safe? No! First of all, the website only checks for one of many hundreds of attack vectors: JavaScript injection from the app itself. And even for those, as of December 2020, app developers can completely hide the JavaScript commands they execute, therefore there is no way for us to verify what is actually happening under the hood. According to the article in Forbes published Aug. 18, 2022, a TikTok representative gave a statement similar to the one given to Snopes: Like other platforms, we use an in-app browser to provide an optimal user experience, but the Javascript code in question is used only for debugging, troubleshooting and performance monitoring of that experience — like checking how quickly a page loads or whether it crashes. However, an article published in The New York Times the next day contradicted this statement — and seemingly TikTok's privacy policy — with a TikTok spokesperson claiming Krause's research was \"incorrect and misleading\" and saying, \"Contrary to the report's claims, we do not collect keystroke or text inputs through this code.\" TikTok confirmed to Snopes the privacy policy has been updated several times \"for a variety of reasons\" since the claim first emerged in 2022, but declined to comment on the discrepancy between the comments made to Forbes and The New York Times. The company's privacy policy also adds that no \"transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure.\" TikTok's website has a page dedicated to explaining its efforts in data security, a program it refers to as \"Project Texas,\" meant to address U.S. national security concerns. Snopes has covered many claims related to internet privacy over the years, including claims that 23AndMe sold genetic data to the Chinese government, that Ovia's reproductive health app requires users to input their geographic location and that copying and pasting a particular message won't stop Meta from scraping user data.",

    "article_text": "Claim: OceanGate's submersible that went missing in June 2023 on a Titanic wreckage exploration relied on Elon Musk’s SpaceX-run Starlink satellites to provide communications during the expedition. Rating: False About this rating Context Starlink is a subsidiary of SpaceX, which Elon Musk runs, and OceanGate indeed said it was relying on the company for the expedition, which included the submersible and a mothership — that is, a vessel that stays above water to navigate and communicate with land during the expedition. However, scientists have pointed out that the submersible would have had an acoustic link with the surface vessel and could not have relied on satellite internet to communicate with the surface. How, or under what circumstances, the mothership used Starlink technology during the expedition remained unknown. Editor's Note: Since the original publication of this fact check on June 20, 2023, Snopes clarified its rating and text to make clear that — while OceanGate, the company overseeing the submersible's expedition, said it was using Starlink satellites for the trip — the submersible itself was not using the technology to communicate. How, or to what extent, the vessel's mothership was using Starlink to communicate remained unknown. On June 18, 2023, the submersible Titan was exploring the wreckage of the Titanic when it lost contact with the chartered research ship it was part of. Search-and-rescue operations soon were underway in the North Atlantic Ocean to bring up the five-person sub, who were facing the loss of oxygen and crushing pressure in the depths of the ocean, as of this writing. When news broke of the failed communications, a number of news reports and posts claimed that the missing submersible was relying on Elon Musk's Starlink satellites for its communications. The missing submarine was using Elon Musk's Starlink satellites for its communications at sea. pic.twitter.com/accJHtCk8t — Pop Crave (@PopCrave) June 19, 2023 The claim is false. As scientists have pointed out, the submersible could not have relied on satellite internet to communicate with the surface while it was underwater. However, it was true that OceanGate, the company that operates the submersible, said it was relying on Starlink technology during the expedition. OceanGate tweeted right before the expedition that it was relying on Starlink: \"Without any cell towers in the middle of the ocean, we are relying on @Starlink to provide the communications we require throughout this year's 2023 Titanic Expedition.\" The wreck of the Titanic lies about 400 miles off the coast of Newfoundland.

According to Starlink's website, \"SpaceX is leveraging its experience in building rockets and spacecraft to deploy the world's most advanced broadband internet system.\" Stefan B. Williams, a professor at the Australian Centre for Field Robotics, University of Sydney, wrote in The Conversation that the submersible's communications were through a transponder that received sonar signals through the water: The Titan would have had an acoustic link with its surface vessel, set up through a transponder (a device for receiving a sonar signal) on its end, and a transceiver (a device that can both transmit and receive communications) on the surface vessel. This link allows for underwater acoustic positioning, as well as for short text messages to be sent back and forth to the surface vessel – but the amount of data that can be shared is limited and usually includes basic telemetry and status information. According to OceanGate's archived FAQs the Titan communicates with its team on the surface primarily through text messages: Titan communicates with the topside comms and tracking team via text messages which are exchanged via a USBL (ultra-short baseline) acoustic system. The sub is required to communicate with topside every fifteen minutes or more frequently if needed. Tracking of the sub's position (lat/long and depth) is achieved through the same system but is controlled by the computer and updates the sub's position every few seconds. We reached out to SpaceX and OceanGate to learn more details about the communications failure and what Starlink was doing to support the rescue efforts. A spokesperson with OceanGate did not confirm or deny the company's relationship with Starlink, and did not respond to our queries on how their submersible communications rely on Starlink satellites, saying he was only able to share the following statement: OceanGate can confirm that CEO Stockton Rush is aboard the submersible as a member of the crew. For some time, we have been unable to establish communications with one of our submersible exploration vehicles which is currently visiting the wreck site of the Titanic. Our entire focus is on the wellbeing of the crew and every step possible is being taken to bring the five crew members back safely. We are deeply grateful for the urgent and extensive assistance we are receiving from multiple government agencies and deep-sea companies as we seek to reestablish contact with the submersible. We pray for the safe return of the crew and passengers, and we will provide updates as they are available. While OceanGate's official Twitter account confirmed that the company did rely on Starlink for communications, Starlink satellites were not used by the submersible to communicate. How, or under what circumstances, the mothership used Starlink technology during the exhibition remained unknown. We rate this claim as \"False\" and will update this post as we get more information.",

    "article_text": "Claim: As cold weather pushed through Germany in February 2021, a “total collapse” in wind and solar energy left Germans in need of coal-fired energy. Rating: Mostly False About this rating What's True It is true that colder temperatures can hamper the ability of wind turbines and solar panels to produce energy. What's False Snopes did not find evidence that Germany was experiencing a “total collapse” in wind and solar energy. Furthermore, both solar panels and wind turbines are capable of functioning under cold and snowy conditions. As Texas struggled with statewide rolling blackouts and much of the United States experienced a potent arctic storm with frigid temperatures and unprecedented ice and snow in February 2021, social media users speculated that frozen wind turbines in Texas played a major role in power outages there ( false ). And across the world, others argued that Germany's renewable energy sources, wind and solar, failed that country, requiring greater output from nuclear and coal production to make up the difference. The allegation stemmed from an article published by Stop These Things ( STT ), an anti-wind website that the Center for Media and Democracy's SourceWatch said promotes \"anecdotes and pseudoscience intended to cast doubt on the effectiveness of wind energy.\" The STT report cited a pseudoscientific blog post published by NoTricksZone on Jan. 28, 2021 , by Pierre Goselin titled, \" Berlin on the Brink! Winter Blackouts Loom As Coal Plants Run At 100% Capacity, Struggle to Keep Lights On .\" Similar claims were shared on Reddit and other publications, including World News Era . While it is true that solar panels and wind turbines can suffer during periods of extreme cold and high snow pilings, it is not accurate to say that Germany experienced a \"total collapse\" of power. It is also inaccurate to say that coal and nuclear power were required to step up to make up the difference. In particular, NoTricksZone cited a video produced by German national broadcaster Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB) that had reportedly been taken down by the channel but was reuploaded to YouTube by wind energy protest group Vernunftkraft.du. NoTricksZone said that in the video, Daniel Bartig, a mechanic at the LEAG Lausitz power plant, said that he was skeptical that green energy can \"do the job\" and that the \"greatest share of power is currently coming from coal.\" Harald Schwarz, professor of power distribution at the University of Cottbus, said that he is \"very skeptical of wind and solar energy doing the job\": With this supply of wind and photovoltaic energy, it's between 0 and 2 or 3 percent – that is de facto zero. You can see it in many diagrams that we have days, weeks, in the year where we have neither wind nor PV. Especially this time for example – there is no wind and PV, and there are often times when the wind is very miniscule. These are things, I must say, that have been physically established and known for centuries, and we've simply totally neglected this during the green energies discussion.\" While our emails to RBB, Schwarz and the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy went unanswered, an investigation into Germany's power grid in early 2021 revealed that such claims were largely unfounded. Germany's Energiewende Movement for Renewable Energy Germany is heralded as a leader in wind and solar power. In 2013, leaders launched Energiewende, a movement to shift the power grid to a more efficient and carbon-neutral system, eliminate electricity generated from nuclear by 2022, and fully phase out coal by 2038. And movements in early 2021 continued a shift from nuclear, as well as coal and oil, to a more diversified system. As of December 2019, about 12% of Germany's electricity came from nuclear energy produced at seven reactors, while over 40% of electricity came from coal, according to the World Nuclear Association , an international organization that promotes nuclear power. By and large, coal was the largest source of power generation in 2019, according to a 2020 report published by the International Energy Agency . Those numbers shifted slightly in 2020, according to preliminary data published by the German Association of Energy and Water Industries (BDEW), which found that 44.6% of energy sourced in Germany in 2020 was from renewables — nearly a quarter of which was produced by onshore and offshore wind, and 8.9% of which was solar, reported Clean Energy Wire . But other energy sources still hold a share in that total. Natural gas made up 16.2%, while nuclear clocked in around 11.4%, and hard coal 7.5%, so it's not out of the ordinary for Germany to be getting its energy from coal and nuclear sources, particularly in the winter. The largest issue with Germany's power grid, according to the IEA, is that most of the wind capacity is located in the northern region whereas most of the demand is in urban regions to the south — and transporting wind power can be a difficult and arduous task. Understanding the Capacity of Solar Panels in Snowy Conditions According to STT report, Germany's \"millions of solar panels are blanketed in snow and ice\" and were \"thus rendered useless\": So much for the 'transition' to an all wind and sun powered future – aka the 'Energiewende'. Despite being the object of consternation and much vilification over the last 20 years, Germany's coal-fired plants are now being appreciated for what they are: truly meaningful power generation sources, available on demand, whatever the weather. With a Nationwide blackout a heartbeat away, the German obsession with unreliable wind and solar is like a time bomb set to explode. It is true that solar panels require sunlight to produce energy and that being covered in snow can hamper their efficiency, but that doesn't mean that they are rendered useless. Most solar panels are tilted at an angle, so snow will slide off on its own. And if it doesn't, caretakers will simply remove the snow without damaging the panels, according to the solar industry company Energy Sage. \"Cold, sunny weather is actually good for panels. Winter months are actually good for solar energy production, as long as your panels aren't covered by snow. Like most electronics, solar panels function more efficiently in cold conditions than in hot,\" wrote the solar industry experts. \"This means that your panels will produce more power for each precious hour of sunshine during the short days of winter.\" And according to the U.S. Department of Energy , a little snow has little impact on solar panels. While heavy snow can limit the amount of energy produced, light is still able to move through the snow — even when panels are completely covered by snow, they can still generate energy. The biggest threat to solar panels from heavy snowfall is weight, which can put stress on the delicate system and photovoltaic panels, which are responsible for generating electricity via sunlight. Operating Wind Turbines in Frigid Temperatures The STT report also claimed that \"freezing weather has halted 30,000 wind turbines,\" which could in part be true. Turbines use wind to make electricity when it rotates the blades around a rotor, which spins a generator to create electricity. But when there is an accumulation of ice on these blades, an increased load can reduce power and damage the blades. Cold weather can also shut down equipment, and in places that are ill-equipped for chilly temperatures, this can slow down energy production. But NoTricksZone reported that 30,000 wind turbines in Germany were largely out of operation, and \"in a world 100% reliant on green energies, this would mean near 100% darkness at home.\" Snopes did not find evidence to confirm that tens of thousands of turbines were out of operation; neither is it true that Germany is fully dependent on green energies — yet.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Opening a text message that says “Trump was arrested” will result in your bank account being attacked. Rating: False About this rating A copypasta warning is circulating online about the purported dangers of opening a scam text message — or potentially an email — that says U.S. President-elect Donald Trump was arrested. According to the claim, opening or clicking on a link in the message will grant scammers access to recipients' bank accounts. This warning began circulating on or just before Nov. 13, 2024, days after Trump's reelection victory and many months after his indictments on a range of criminal charges. Snopes received numerous reader inquiries about the warning. For example, one reader asked, \"Is it true there is a scam going on about a message that Trump got arrested, and if you click on it, they will scam and get access to your bank account?\" Another reader shared a copied and pasted version of the rumor that claimed, \" Warning! If you get a text that Trump was arrested don't open it because it will attack your bank account. Tell all your friends.\" X users shared the rumor , with one person posting ( archived ), in part, \"HEADS UP! If you get a text that Trump was arrested don't open it because it will attack your bank account. Tell all your friends. Delete immediately. May be nothing, but got from a reliable source.\" A Facebook user also posted the rumor with a bright red background, writing ( archived ), \" Warning! If you get a text Trump was arrested don't open it! It will attack your bank account.\" The warning is a hoax, however. We have yet to locate any screenshots or transcripts of an actual text message fitting this description. The hoax is similar to one we reported about in October 2016, which falsely claimed that clicking on a picture of Trump in a social media post titled \"Donald Trump Arrested\" would install a virus on users' devices. We received nearly 20 reader emails and reviewed dozens of social media posts — and their comments — that warned users of the purported dangers of interacting with the \"Trump arrested\" text message. None of the emails, posts or comments, featured a screenshot or transcript of the supposed text message. Many of the emails and posts — and at least one YouTube user ( archived ) — said they learned of the matter from a family member, friend or acquaintance. We couldn't determine who started the hoax. Further online searches — including of Reddit.com and its ever-reliable r/Scams community — produced no credible discussions about the purported scam or screenshots of the text message. What To Know About Text Scams Despite what some of the users claimed, consumers can't get scammed simply by opening and reading a text message. For a scam to succeed, the scammers typically need recipients to respond to the message or click on a link. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published a full guide on text message scams, primarily that scammers attempt to steal consumers' personal and financial information. If any readers provided personal or financial details to scammers, we recommend reporting the text messages to the FTC using the instructions at the bottom of their guide. Additionally, we advise contacting the associated bank or credit card company — either by visiting a branch or calling an official number (not one provided in the scam text) — to address the issue. If you find additional details on the purported \"Trump arrested\" scam text message, please reach out to us .",

    "article_text": "Claim: Former U.S. President Donald Trump was banned for life from Facebook in May 2021. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True On May 5, 2021, the Facebook Oversight Board upheld Facebook's decision to prohibit former President Donald Trump's use of the social network following an attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. However... What's False The Facebook Oversight Board did not say that this was ban was permanent. Rather, the group told Facebook that they had six months to decide if this ban should be permanent. On May 5, 2021, the Facebook Oversight Board announced that it had made a decision regarding former U.S. President Donald Trump's ban from the social network. As this news circulated, many people rushed to social media (and television) with incorrect statements about the board's decision. On Fox News, for example, a chyron briefly appeared that stated: \"Facebook Oversight Board Bans Trump for Life.\" The Twitter account for Newsmax also posted a message stating that \"Facebook has decided to permanently ban former President Donald Trump from its platform.\" But Trump has not been banned for life from Facebook. Yet. On Jan 6. 2021, a violent mob stormed the Capitol in an attempt to delay the certification of President Joe Biden's electoral victory spurred on in part by the multitude of election falsehoods that Trump had peddled. In the days after the attack, several social media networks announced that they were banning Trump to prevent him from posting messages that could encourage further violence. Twitter, for instance, announced that they had \"permanently suspended [Trump's] account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.\" Facebook made a similar announcement . However, Facebook said that they were banning Trump's account for an \"indefinite\" period of time (not permanently) as they believed he would continue to use his account to \"undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor.\" A few weeks later, Facebook announced that it had formed an independent Oversight Board that would review the merits of Trump's suspension: We believe our decision was necessary and right. Given its significance, we think it is important for the board to review it and reach an independent judgment on whether it should be upheld. While we await the board’s decision, Mr. Trump’s access will remain suspended indefinitely. We look forward to receiving the board’s decision — and we hope, given the clear justification for our actions on January 7, that it will uphold the choices we made. In addition to the board’s determination on whether to uphold or overturn the indefinite suspension, Facebook welcomes any observations or recommendations from the board around suspensions when the user is a political leader. On May 5, Facebook's Oversight Board announced that it upheld Facebook's initial decision to suspend Trump's account. However, the board did not state that this ban should be permanent. Rather, the board said that it was \"not appropriate\" for Facebook to suspend Trump's account for an indefinite period of time and gave Facebook six months to determine if Trump's account should be permanently banned. The Facebook Oversight Board wrote : The Board has upheld Facebook’s decision on January 7, 2021, to restrict then-President Donald Trump’s access to posting content on his Facebook page and Instagram account. However, it was not appropriate for Facebook to impose the indeterminate and standardless penalty of indefinite suspension. Facebook’s normal penalties include removing the violating content, imposing a time-bound period of suspension, or permanently disabling the page and account. The Board insists that Facebook review this matter to determine and justify a proportionate response that is consistent with the rules that are applied to other users of its platform. Facebook must complete its review of this matter within six months of the date of this decision. The Board also made policy recommendations for Facebook to implement in developing clear, necessary, and proportionate policies that promote public safety and respect freedom of expression. In other words, while Trump is still banned from Facebook, that could change (or could be made permanent) within six months.",

A spokesperson for Twitter told us that, \"If an account is mentioned often alongside certain terms, they can become algorithmically surfaced together as a recommendation.\" In other words, Trump's account has been mentioned alongside the word \"racist\" so often (either by critics calling the president \"racist\" or by defenders saying he is not \"racist\"), that Trump's account rose to the top of the search results.

    "article_text": "Claim: Donald Trump's Twitter ban means the National Archives and Records Administration will be unable to maintain, on Twitter, an archived version of tweets issued from the @realdonaldtrump account. Rating: True About this rating Context While the @realdonaldtrump Twitter account remains archived and preserved in myriad digital locations, the official National Archives and Records Administration practice of maintaining an archive account of Donald Trump's personal Twitter on that platform won't be possible under Twitter's rules. Since 2017, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has taken control of government twitter accounts associated with past administrations at the end of their terms. For example, the White House Twitter account (@WhiteHouse) used during President Barack Obama's time in office is maintained by NARA on Twitter with the handle @WhiteHouse44. The White House Twitter account during President Donald Trump 's time in office is similarly maintained by NARA on Twitter under @WhiteHouse45. As stated on NARA's Donald J. Trump Presidential Library website, the office also maintains, or plans to maintain, archives of individual accounts associated with the Trump Administration. \"A number of Trump administration officials, including President Trump, used personal accounts when conducting government business,\" the website reads. \"The National Archives will make the social media content from those designated accounts publicly available as soon as possible.\" In terms of Trump's personal account, @realdonaldtrump, which was permanently banned for incitement of violence following the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection, Twitter told Politico that it won't allow an archived version of those tweets to appear on their platform: “Given that we permanently suspended @realDonaldTrump, the content from the account will not appear on Twitter as it did previously or as archived administration accounts do currently, regardless of how NARA decides to display the data it has preserved,” Twitter spokesperson Trenton Kennedy said in an email. “Administration accounts that are archived on the service are accounts that were not in violation of the Twitter Rules.” Regardless of Twitter's ban, NARA says it will still maintain an archive of tweets sent by Trump's personal account, and several websites presently exist that provide a record not only of all of Trump's tweets , but all of the deleted ones as well. Because Twitter has said they will not allow NARA to maintain an archived version of @realdonaldtrump on their platform, the claim is \"True.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: Former President Donald Trump's \"Truth Social\" platform will cost users $4.99 a week. Rating: False About this rating Origin In mid-February 2022, Truth Social, a new social media platform that was announced by former U.S. President Donald Trump after he was kicked off of established platforms such as Twitter and Facebook over fears that he would incite more violence against government institutions , took another step closer to launch as beta testing went live on the new app . As news circulated on social media about the impending launch of Trump's social media network, rumors started to circulate that users of the new \"free speech\" platform would have to pay a weekly fee of $4.99. This isn't the case. Truth Social is not charging a weekly fee of $4.99 to users. The Daily Dot reported : \"Twitter users have been spreading the claim that Truth Social, former President Donald Trump’s yet-to-be-launched social media platform, intends to charge users $4.99 per week. But the allegation isn’t actually true.\" The claim that Truth Social was charging $4.99 a week was largely based on a screenshot that supposedly showed the new app's pricing scheme. The following image, however, does not come from Truth Social. This screenshot shows a different app called 2nd1st. While it's possible that this miscaptioned screenshot was shared with the intent of bringing bad press to Trump's new app, it's also possible that this was done in error, as 2nd1st bills itself as \"America's social app for truth,\" calls itself the free speech platform, and includes several pictures of the Trump family on its app page. In fact, back in October 2021, Trump sent a cease and desist letter demanding that the app stopped using his likeness. The NY Post reported : A mysterious social media app appears to be luring people to pay $4.99 a week to access the app while claiming that President Donald Trump is on the platform. The ex-president has hit the company with a cease-and-desist letter, The Post has learned. The letter demands that the app stop using Trump’s likeness. We reached out to the Trump Media & Technology Group for additional information, but have not yet received a response. As of this writing, Truth Social is listed on the App Store as a free app. Truth Social has not officially launched yet. While it's possible that some sort of subscription model will be introduced on the app, the claim that Truth Social is charging $4.99 a week appears to be based on a screenshot of a different app.",

The devices were removed nationwide by 2013, however. According to an illustrated X (formerly Twitter) post dated Jan. 18, 2024, the Transport Security Administration (TSA) “can see your c*ck and b*lls whenever you walk through the X-ray scanner.” The post (screenshot below) received hundreds of thousands of views before it was hidden by the user. An archived version still exists. (@Ragland1836 / X) Though the image included in the post was genuine, Snopes determined through a reverse-image search using Yandex ( archived ) that the earliest known instance of the photo on the internet was posted in 2010 . Posts similar to the one above have circulated for many years. At that time (2010), TSA was rolling out its new body-scanning technology, the so-called \"backscatter unit.\" “Backscatter technology projects low level X-ray beams over the body to create a reflection of the body displayed on the monitor,” explained TSA in a “How It Works” blog, noting that the technology \"produces an image that resembles a chalk etching.” By the end of 2010, hundreds of “full-body scanners” were formally installed at U.S. airports, according to TSA . Such units were used to detect non-metallic weapons explosives and other threats that could be concealed under clothing to evade traditional metal detectors already in place. “Backscatter passenger scanners are used to detect threats such as weapons or explosives that a person could be carrying under their clothing. Backscatter machines use very low energy x-rays that are reflected back to the machine itself,” wrote the Environmental Protection Agency in a digital explainer. “Generally, the amount of radiation received from a backscatter machine equals the amount of cosmic radiation received during two minutes of flight and the risk of health effects is very, very low.” Handouts distributed at the time indicated that images voluntarily collected were “viewed in a remote location” and were not saved or stored, but rather were immediately deleted “ after review and resolution of any anomaly .” But backscatter scanners were short-lived. Deemed by some as “ digital strip searches ,” the machines were removed from U.S. airports after users expressed concern over the lack of privacy. TSA, on the other hand, noted that the scanners slowed down security checkpoints . Millimeter-wave technology similar to those commonly used in airports at the time of this publication r eplaced the backscatter scanners , offering a more cartoon-like (i.e., less revealing) image of people as they passed through the scanners.",

    "article_text": "Claim: In mid-December 2020, Twitter users were unable to retweet, reply to, or like incumbent U.S. President Donald Trump’s tweets. Rating: Outdated About this rating On Dec. 12, 2020, Twitter users noticed some unusual lack of activity surrounding U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest tweets. That’s because Twitter briefly prevented users from liking, replying, or retweeting a series of tweets posted by Trump that were disputing the results of the 2020 presidential election. Users were still allowed to retweet the tweet with a comment, as shown in screenshots of banners explaining the restriction: “We try to prevent a Tweet like this that otherwise breaks the Twitter Rules from reaching more people, so we’ve disabled most of the ways to engage with it. If you want to talk about it, you can still Retweet with comment.” The restrictions came as Trump tweeted about the Supreme Court’s rejection of Texas’ bid to overturn the presidential election. He called this “a great and disgraceful miscarriage of justice.” His tweet , that “he won the election in a landslide,” was also briefly restricted by Twitter. In a statement to the media , Twitter admitted that it had briefly limited engagement with certain tweets, saying, “We inadvertently took action to limit engagements on the labeled Tweet. This action has been reversed, and you can now engage with the Tweet, but in line with our Civic Integrity Policy it will continue to be labeled in order to give more context for anyone who might see the Tweet.” The Civic Integrity Policy states: You may not use Twitter’s services for the purpose of manipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes. This includes posting or sharing content that may suppress participation or mislead people about when, where, or how to participate in a civic process. In addition, we may label and reduce the visibility of Tweets containing false or misleading information about civic processes in order to provide additional context. Indeed, the social media platform still has warning labels attached to a number of Trump’s tweets because of the \"disputed\" accuracy of his claims. Given that Twitter did briefly limit interactions with Trump’s tweets, but reversed the action shortly after, we rate this claim as “Outdated.”",

Rating: True About this rating On July 21, 2021, Twitter announced on its verified support account that it would begin testing an option to upvote or downvote on replies made on the social media platform for select Mac iOS users. Downvotes would not be made public, while upvotes would be shown as likes, according to the social media platform. As of this writing, Twitter Support said the test was only in the research phase, and was only made available on iOS systems. Downvotes are only visible to the original poster and votes won’t change the order of replies. Upvoting a reply as part of the test will be treated as a like, and the original poster will be notified when the reply shows up in their “likes” tab. “This isn’t quite a dislike button. In this research experiment, the thumbs down icon is a down vote that lets us know that you think the reply isn’t relevant to the conversation,” wrote Twitter. “We want to better understand the types of replies you do and don’t find relevant in a convo.” It is unclear how many accounts will be affected by the test, when it will begin, or how long the research phase will last. Snopes contacted the Twitter team, and will update the article accordingly as more information becomes available.",

Rating: Mixture About this rating Context On April 1, 2022, the official account of Twitter tweeted that it had been working on an \"edit\" button in what many users thought was an April Fools' Day prank. Four days later, the platform announced that it had, indeed, been working on an edit feature since 2021 and planned to kick off testing in 2022. However, the platform did not formally announce when — or if — that feature would rolled out to all users. April Fools' Day 2022 is upon us, and Snopes is here to separate the truth from the hoaxes. Send us questions , read our fact checks, and be sure to support the fact-checkers ! On April 1, 2022, Twitter’s verified account posted to the social media platform that it was “working on an edit button.” A quick look at the date led our team to believe that this was, in fact, an April Fools' Day prank. So, we reached out to the social media platform directly. In an emailed statement to Snopes, a spokesperson wrote: “We cannot confirm or deny but we may edit our statement later.” As of this writing, the tweet had been liked more than 53,000 times. But our hunch was incorrect. On April 5, the social media platform revealed that it had been working on an edit feature since 2021. According to a Tweet shared by the verified Twitter Comms account, the platform is kicking off testing in 2022 to \"learn what works, what doesn't, and what's possible.\" The announcement was made after Tesla CEO Elon Musk hinted at the possibility of an edit button after he was named T witter's biggest stakeholder and was appointed to the platform's board of directions. However, whether that testing will result in a fully functional edit button for all users remains to be seen. While we can now definitively say that Twitter is testing the feature, it's still fun to take a look back at the many social media users who highlighted the coincidental date of the original \"edit\" post: Another reminded the platform of its history of sassy posts about edit buttons: And a previous notion of implementing a dislike option: Until the test of time tells us whether Twitter does, in fact, roll out an “edit” option — or edit the previous tweet on the edit option — we’ve rated this claim as “Research in Progress.” (Even though we’re pretty sure it’s a joke.) We'll edit, er update, the article accordingly.",

Rating: Labeled Satire About this rating On Dec. 8, 2022, we received reader inquiries that pointed to a headline from the Piss Daily website , which read, \"Twitter Employees Forced To 'Say The N-Word' To Keep Their Jobs.\" The article said that Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter led to a new and unusual policy: Elon Musk has been making some drastic changes to Twitter, and has completely gutted the company. Tons of people have lost their jobs, right-wing profiles have been reinstated, and Twitter has begun selling blue checkmarks in an attempt to generate revenue. Some have speculated that the site itself will end up being shut down, due to Elon's reckless and chaotic methods to \"fix\" the site. But out of all these strange new policies, the weirdest one is part of Elon's push to make Twitter more \"based\". Every employee is now required, at least once a day if not more often, to \"say the N word\". Pretty much whenever Elon prompts them, with many now former employees coming forward and saying they were fired on the spot for not saying it. However, this story originated on PissDaily.com, a website that showed a disclaimer on its \"Legal\" page that said it published parody and satire.

    "article_text": "Claim: The Twitter \"Home\" icon is designed to look like a birdhouse. Rating: True About this rating Fact Check Some realizations come late, as when, for example, parts of the internet recently figured out that the Twitter \"Home\" icon could actually be a based off a birdhouse. This is the Twitter \"Home\" button at the top of the column: Here are pictures of birdhouses: mrmrchaves/Wikimedia Commons Benoît Prieur/Wikimedia Commons Birdhouses come in all shapes and sizes, but mainly function as a shelter for birds. Often referred to as “ nest boxes ,” according to the Audubon Society, they “provide valuable homes for many species of birds and a wonderful opportunity for birdwatchers to enjoy viewing the age-old process of breeding.” The button has been referred to as a “birdhouse” for years in the media. In 2017, when discussing Twitter’s redesign, Wired wrote, “The home icon is still a birdhouse, but it lost the perch — you'll see just one hole instead of two.” In 2021, the New York Times wrote about Twitter’s failed attempt at “Fleet” and described all the icons: “All of the little mixed-metaphor icons — the birdhouse, the magnifying glass, the bell, the envelope, the quill (?) with a plus sign (??) — seemed to be in order.” A Twitter spokesperson confirmed to us directly that the “Home” icon is actually a birdhouse. We thus rate this claim as \"True.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: Uber increases ride prices for customers with low phone batteries. Rating: Unproven About this rating What's True It's true Uber has access to customers' phone battery information, according to statements from company officials. What's False A screenshot that allegedly depicts the Uber app telling a customer, \"Your phone's battery is low, so we increased prices\" appears to have been fabricated by an account on X known for satirical posts. What's Undetermined The company has consistently denied the claim that users' battery information is used for surge pricing. Until independent evidence surfaces to verify the company's position and debunk the rumor — such as a comprehensive study across a variety of geographic locations, times, traffic conditions and other variables — the claim remains unproven. For years, a rumor has circulated alleging the ride-hailing app Uber increases ride prices for customers with low phone batteries. For instance, a popular Reddit post with the claim displays an alleged screenshot of the app with a message to the customer, \"Your phone's battery is low, so we increased prices. You may want to book fast.\" In October 2024, the claim surfaced again on Threads , with a user asking, \"Did you know that Uber will charge you up to 3x the price if your battery is low?\" (Versole on Reddit) One Reddit user responded , \" This seems a bit criminal. Better plug my phone up 30 minutes before you order an uber. \" Another wrote , \"Yes it is a known fact they charge pax [sic] more for a low battery [battery emoji] TRUE ! Been proved more than once. Don't believe try at home yourselves. \" This claim first became popular in 2016 following an appearance by Uber's then-head of economic research, Keith Chen, on NPR's Hidden Brain . While discussing his career as a behavioral economist and the specific behavioral trends Uber had observed, Chen told NPR: We do though, you know, in the Uber data, see a lot of really, really interesting patterns. So, for example, a data scientist named Peter at Uber discovered somewhat accidentally this really, really kind of interesting fact. And that is one of the strongest predictors of whether or not you are going to be sensitive to surge — in other words, whether or not you are going to kind of say, oh, 2.2, 2.3, I'll give it a 10 to 15 minutes to see if surge goes away — is how much battery you have left on your cellphone. […] When your cellphone is like down to like below 5% battery and that little icon on the iPhone turns red, you know, then people start saying, well, I better get home, like, because I don't quite know how I'm going to get home otherwise. And we absolutely don't use that to kind of like push you a higher surge price, but it's an interesting kind of psychological fact of human behavior. In other words, in the 2016 interview, Chen said Uber did indeed have access to battery charge information but was not using it to increase surge pricing. Instead, he suggested users were more likely to pay the surge prices if their phone battery was low, rather than wait for the price to drop and risk their phone going dead. So it's true Uber has access to customers' phone battery information, according to the company itself. However, Uber has consistently denied the claim that it uses that information to increase prices. Until independent evidence surfaces to verify the company's position and debunk the rumor — such as a comprehensive study across a variety of geographic locations, times, traffic conditions and other variables — the claim remains unproven. Also, the above-displayed screenshot that allegedly depicts the Uber app telling a customer, \"Your phone's battery is low, so we increased prices\" appears to be created by an account on X known for satirical posts before spreading to Reddit. Uber Denies the Claim In order to use Uber, customers agree to let the company have access to certain phone data, including battery life. As per the company's terms and conditions : We collect data about the devices used to access our services, including the hardware models, device IP address or other unique device identifiers, operating systems and versions, software, preferred languages, advertising identifiers, device motion data and mobile network data. Furthermore, the company is transparent about using what it calls \" surge pricing \" — or, changing prices for rides based on real-time demand. While adjusting prices, it says it considers market conditions, such as how many drivers are available at a particular time, as well as whether any major emergencies are affecting public safety. The company says of surge pricing: Surge pricing is a relief valve for the rideshare marketplace. Without it, when demand for rides exceeds the number of available drivers, riders would wait longer (or might not be able to get a ride at all). Drivers would have less incentive to accept requests in busy areas. Surge pricing helps restore balance to the network. By waiting a bit longer, riders can avoid the surge price. But the company has consistently denied the claim that it uses phone battery data to set prices, and there have yet to be any comprehensive, independent studies to confirm that position. Small experiments Experiments with small sample groups have tested the claim, however. In 2023, The Brussels Times , self-described as \"Belgium's largest daily news media in English,\" called Uber rides from two different phones at different battery levels and reported the ride requested by the phone with the lower charge was pricier. Uber responded in a statement: Uber does not take into account the phone's battery level to calculate the price of a trip. The dynamic pricing applied to trips booked via Uber is determined by the existing demand for rides and the supply of drivers who can respond to it. During peak hours, when there are many ride requests and few available drivers in a certain geographical area, this may affect the price of the trip. WKYC , a TV news station in Cleveland, repeated the experiment — again, with only two phones — and got the same price for both. In a statement, Uber reiterated its previous position : Uber does not use personalized pricing nor is battery life a factor in determining fares. Pricing is optimized for the network as a whole, not any one individual rider or driver. In July 2024, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, issued a statement calling on Uber — as well as its main competitor, Lyft — for more transparency in its surge pricing practices and directly mentioned the 2016 NPR interview with Chen: Historically, Uber has denied claims that it uses consumers' private data to set fares; however, in 2016, the head of economic research at Uber, Keith Chen, stated that one of the strongest predictors of customers' willingness to pay for increased fares was the amount of battery left on a device. More recent research has shown that Uber's prices increase when a device has low battery — suggesting that Uber preys upon the perceived desperation of their customers. Instead of enabling consumers to make informed decisions, aggressive companies — like Uber — exploit technology and consumer data to manipulate consumers, extracting every last cent possible from them. Snopes reached out to Uber's communications team seeking any additional information about the claim and the company's response to it. We will update this article if we hear back.",

    "article_text": "Claim: If phone users in the U.K. do not acknowledge or reply to an emergency text alert test on April 23, 2023, their phones will be locked by the U.K. government for the day. Rating: Mostly False About this rating What's True On April 23, 2023, the U.K. will implement a nationwide test of its emergency alerts service. The alert will ring for around 10 seconds on people’s phones, and they must acknowledge the alert by hitting an “OK” button before they can use other features on their devices. What's False Users do not have to reply to the emergency alert. While users have to acknowledge it in order to use other features on their phone, the process is much like acknowledging a “low battery” warning on a mobile device. Users also have the option to disable emergency alerts on their phones. On March 20, 2023, internet users tweeted about the U.K. government's testing of an emergency alert system set for April 23, 2023. Many claimed that refusing to acknowledge or reply to the alert would result in their phones being locked down by the government. It's true that on that date, the U.K. government plans to conduct a nationwide test of the emergency alerts service. This will involve a siren-like alert being sent to smartphone users across the U.K. Alerts like this are normally used to warn the public of urgent life-threatening situations like floods, wildfires, and more. But the impending emergency alerts test has resulted in a number of unsubstantiated rumors. A Reddit user asked, \"Could the April 23rd emergency alert system lock down your mobile phone?\" adding, \"two family members have told me that with the government's test of the emergency alarm on the 23rd of April if you fail to acknowledge it on your phone that the government will lock down your phone. They've even gone as far as to turn off some alarm settings on the phone.\" Twitter user @karma44921039 shared a video in which a man claimed, \"If you don't reply to that text message, basically the use of your phone is going to be limited. So they're going to cut your phone off for the day.\" He added that replying would allow the government to have access to \"elements\" of your phone. These claims largely misrepresent what is a routine emergency alert method that is used numerous times by different authorities, including in states across the U.S. While smartphone users are required to acknowledge the alert message in order to use certain features on the phone, this is not as big a deal as the above posts make it out to be. We reached out to the U.K. Cabinet Office and asked bout some of the above claims, specifically about whether phones will be locked down if users refuse to acknowledge the message, and the office directed us to its news release and FAQs . According to the FAQs on the government site, an emergency alert is meant to be a warning about potential nearby threats (emphasis, ours): Emergency Alerts will appear on your device and you will hear a loud siren-like sound for up to 10 seconds. It will appear on your device's home screen and you must acknowledge it before you can use other features. They appear as a notification and may include telephone numbers or website links containing further information. A loud, siren-like sound and vibration will accompany the message to raise awareness of the hazard or threat. It is indeed correct that one has to acknowledge the alert by clicking an \"OK\" button as illustrated in the video below. After acknowledging it, people can operate the phone normally. However, users do not have to reply to emergency alerts as the Twitter video claimed. According to the FAQs , \"When you receive the Welcome Message you do not need to take any action. The siren will stop automatically after ten seconds. A welcome message will stay on screen until you acknowledge it, just like a 'low battery' warning.\" Users also have the ability to turn off all emergency alerts from the government on smartphones. IPhone users just have to go to their \"Settings\" and then to \"Notifications,\" where they can scroll to the bottom of the screen and find the option to turn \"Government Alerts\" on or off. Android users also can go to their \"Settings\" page, then go to \"Notifications\" and \"Wireless emergency alerts,\" where they can select the alerts they want to receive. The FAQs also pointed out that the government does not rely on personal data to send an alert: \"The system uses the cell tower your phone is connected to. When an alert is triggered, all towers in the area will broadcast the alert. To do this the Government does not need to know the specific location or personal data on your device.\" The Cabinet Office added that successful alert tests already took place in certain regions of the U.K., like East Suffolk and Reading. They emphasized that such alerts are \"one-way\" and do not collect personal data. Cabinet Minister Oliver Dowden told the BBC the warnings are sent in a \"very targeted way\" and \"revolutionize our ability to warn and inform people who are in immediate danger.\" While it is indeed true that smartphone users have to acknowledge the alert by pressing \"OK\" before they can use other features on their phone, they do not have to reply or do anything else. Clicking \"OK\" on their phone is much like acknowledging a low battery notification and does not have the drastic implications that the posts are suggesting. As such we rate this claim as \"Mostly False.\"",

Russian television, and numerous posts on social media , were spreading misinformation regarding the so-called “Nazi” threat in Ukraine, and more. In response, the Ukrainian government sent letters to numerous tech and social media companies to block access to their platforms in Russia. Deputy Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov posted some of these letters to the CEOs of Meta, YouTube, Google, and Netflix on his Instagram account. In a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg dated Feb. 25, 2022, Federov wrote : “I appeal to you to block access of the Russian Federation citizens to facebook and Instagram services! We are sure that such action will motivate youth and active population of Russia to proactively stop the disgraceful military aggression.” A statement posted to Ukraine’s Ministry of Culture and Information Policy’s official website on Feb. 27, 2022, stated that the ministry also called on Zuckerberg to “block the Facebook pages of Russian propaganda channels” including, “Pervyy Kanal, Rossyia 1, Match TV, NTV, Piatyy Kanal, Rossiya 24, Rossiya K (Culture), Carousel, OTR, TVTzentr, REN TV, Spas, Domashnii, TV-3, Piatnitsa, Zvezda, Myr, TNT, Muz-TV and others that spread Kremlin propaganda.” Meta posted a statement on Feb. 26, 2022, saying they were “taking extensive steps to fight the spread of misinformation by expanding our third-party fact-checking capacity in Russian and Ukrainian. We’re also providing more transparency around state-controlled media outlets, prohibiting ads from Russian state media and demonetizing their accounts.” On Feb. 27, 2022, Meta added an update : “We have been in contact with the government of Ukraine. At their request, we have restricted access to several accounts in Ukraine, including those belonging to some Russian state media organizations. We are also reviewing other government requests to restrict Russian state controlled media.” Fedorov tweeted more about the Ukrainian government’s appeals, and updated with responses from tech companies: Given that all the official accounts are sharing these communications, we rate this claim as “True.” Previous Article Next Article Article 43 of 98 in Collection",

    "article_text": "Claim: Video authentically shows large high-tech umbrellas opening to provide shade to pilgrims visiting a mosque in Medina, Saudi Arabia. Rating: True About this rating In June 2025, footage on TikTok and YouTube showed lines of large mechanized umbrellas opening above pedestrians and giving them shade. The captions for these videos stated these were high-tech umbrellas in Medina, Saudi Arabia that provided shade to pilgrims visiting the Masjid an-Nabawi, also known as the Prophet's Mosque, one of the holiest sites for Muslims worldwide. The above footage is authentic. The piazza around the Prophet's Mosque in Medina does have all these mechanized umbrellas that open and close at different hours in order to provide shade to pilgrims. As such, we rate this claim as true. We found photographs and footage of the umbrellas on Getty Images. The photographs, taken by Amir Mukhtar, show the umbrellas open during the day and night. Footage on Getty Images also shows the umbrella opening at dawn. The photographs below show pilgrims gathered outside of the Prophet's Mosque: (Amir Mukhtar/Getty Images) (Amir Mukhtar/Getty Images) According to Sustainability Magazine , a news outlet focused on sustainability in business, a German engineering firm undertook the project for the Saudi government in 2008. Liebherr-Werk Ehingen, a subsidiary of Liebherr Group, was commissioned to do the work by the Saudi Binladin Group. The engineering firm's official Instagram account shared footage and photographs of the umbrellas opening and closing: According to the firm's website , the prototype for this umbrella was developed in 1988: In 1988, SL Rasch developed the prototype of a convertible umbrella as a study for the potential shading system on the large piazza around the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. This was the first umbrella with a folding arm system, and its mechanism permits a maximum span of more than 12 metres. The structure is designed for wind speeds of up to 155 kilometres per hour – in both deployed and folded position. An anemometer ensures the umbrella is prevented from opening or closing when a strong wind is blowing. According to Senatus, a lifestyle magazine , the project was completed in 2010 and had 250 umbrellas, each 20 meters (66 feet) tall and covering an area of 25.5 meters by 25.5 meters (84 feet by 84 feet) when open. Rising temperatures have made pilgrimage to sites in Saudi Arabia difficult for Muslims around the world and have resulted in numerous deaths from heat stress over the years. The Prophet's Mosque is an important destination for pilgrims, and the umbrellas have reportedly reduced temperatures in the area by around 8 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit). The design also features hydraulic cylinders that adjust and cool the area, as well as water misting systems.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A locked iPhone can be unlocked with a secret code in Apple's Calculator app. Rating: False About this rating Since at least 2019, TikTok has sort of become the modern-day, go-to spot for watching videos that purportedly expose or reveal secrets about a variety of topics. We previously covered TikTok videos that revealed Chick-fil-A's nuggets prep process and \"exposed\" Panera Bread's frozen soups and other foods. We even debunked a TikTok video that claimed to reveal zombies found on Google Earth. So it came as no surprise when a TikTok video claimed to reveal how to unlock any iPhone — the same device used by millions of people to view said TikTok videos. On Dec. 7, 2020, TikTok user @f_y_._p posted a video that claimed to show \"How to Unlock Anybody's iPhone.\" After three days, it had been viewed nearly 4 million times. The video showed what appeared to be a child covering the top of an iPhone to stop facial recognition from automatically unlocking the device. ( Face ID is Apple's technology for facial recognition, and is a security component in iPhone devices that allows iPhone owners to unlock their device with ease, simply by looking at it.) The person in the video covered the front camera on the phone for the purpose of the demonstration in the video. A series of onscreen buttons were then tapped. The Calculator app was opened. In the calculator, the combination \"7x4+EE=C\" was tapped. The user then swiped up, and the iPhone appeared to unlock. What appeared to be a secret code was actually nothing of the sort. While the person in the video covered up the camera at the beginning of the video, he or she later removed the hand from covering the camera. The iPhone unlocked not because of a secret code, but rather because it recognized its owner. For some readers, this may have brought back memories of the early days of computer labs and Windows 98. With an early version of Windows such as Windows 98, it was possible to open an internet browser even if the administrator had restricted access to the internet. A YouTube video showed a similar exploit in Windows 98. A comment on an old thread on the Y Combinator website recalled the trick: Reminds me of how we had Windows 98 computers at school which required an administrator password to access the internet, else the system was limited to a few applications. We managed by opening a text editor or Word or whatever, file -> open, right-click a file, Explore which gave you access to the file system. Typing in an URL in the address bar changed windows explorer to internet explorer (a feature which MS later had to pay a fine and a browser selection window for), and huzzah, internets!",

    "rating": "Mostly False",
    "article_text": "Claim: In March 2021, Utah passed a law banning pornography on mobile devices. Rating: Mostly False About this rating What's True In March 2021, Utah's governor did sign into law a bill, H.B. 72, that would require mobile device manufacturers to install adult content filters that were switched on by default when a device was first activated. However... What's False H.B. 72 imposed no prohibition or penalties for viewing, hosting, or broadcasting pornography, and thus did not constitute a \"ban.\" Furthermore, the bill would enable adult device users to deactivate the content filters. As well as not constituting a prohibition on pornography, H.B. 72 did not have a known implementation date, and under its own provisions, might never take effect. In March 2021, various online reports claimed that Utah had passed a law banning pornography on cellphones and tablets. For example, on March 24, Unilad.co.uk published an article with the headline \"Utah passes law banning pornography on cellphones,\" which stated that: \"The governor of Utah has signed a divisive measure to ban pornography on cellphones in the state. Under the new legislation, signed Tuesday, March 23, all cellphones and tablets sold in Utah would be required to automatically block pornography.\" Several other reports referred to a porn \"ban\" in the state, including articles by the London Independent and People magazine. In reality, the law passed by legislators and signed by the governor would not ban porn from mobile devices or outlaw viewing porn on such devices in Utah. Reports containing such descriptions were flawed. Rather, the legislation would require the device manufacturers to install content filters that are switched on by default, when a user first activates the device. The law would enable adult users to subsequently deactivate those filters. As most articles noted, the legislation also came with an unusual condition — it would not come into effect until or unless five other state legislatures had passed similar laws, and if that condition was not met by 2031, the Utah law would itself be repealed. As a result of these facts, we are issuing a rating of \"Mostly False.\" What Utah's Porn Law Says House Bill (H.B.) 72, entitled \"Device Filter Amendments,\" was introduced in the Utah House of Representatives in January 2021, by its chief sponsor Rep. Susan Pulsipher, a Republican. Its primary sponsor in the Senate is Sen. Wayne Harper, another Republican. It was passed by both chambers, and subsequently signed into law by Republican Gov. Spencer Cox on March 23. The bill signed by Cox contained the following key component: Beginning on January 1 of the year following the year this bill takes effect, a manufacturer shall manufacture a device that, when activated in the state, automatically enables a filter that: (1) when enabled, prevents the user from accessing or downloading material that is harmful to minors on: (a) mobile data networks; (b) applications owned and controlled by the manufacturer; (c) wired Internet networks; and (d) wireless Internet networks; (2) notifies the user of the device when the filter blocks the device from downloading an application or accessing a website; (3) gives a user with a passcode the opportunity to unblock a filtered application or website; and (4) reasonably precludes a user other than a user with a passcode the opportunity to deactivate, modify, or uninstall the filter. In the legislation, \"material that is harmful to minors\" is specified as content that conforms to definitions already existing in Utah law. H.B. 72 does not impose any penalties for viewing, hosting, or broadcasting pornography in Utah, so it is simply not accurate to describe it as a \"ban\" on pornography. Rather, it requires device manufacturers to install content filters, and to switch those filters on by default when a user first activates a device. The legislation imposes a fine for manufacturers who fail to install those filters by default, and leaves them open to being sued in cases where it can be proven that they failed to take steps to install the filters, and a child was subsequently exposed to pornography as a result. Adult users could deactivate the content filters using a passcode. The text of H.B. 72 does not stipulate which users would receive passcodes, how the passcodes would be distributed, and under what conditions, if any, so we asked the bill's main sponsor, Pulsipher, for details. By email, she clarified for Snopes that adult users would not require any special permission to receive a passcode, and said it would be up to manufacturers to decide how best to distribute the passcodes: \"This bill is meant help parents keep their children safe, especially from unintended exposure that comes when filters are not turned on. An adult user could simply turn the filter off at any time and for any reason using the passcode that would be given as a matter of course.\" According to the text of the bill itself, the provisions and requirements of H.B. 72 would not take effect until \"the first day of January following the day on which at least five states, other than Utah, pass legislation in substantially the same form.\" The legislation also specifies that if its provisions have not come into effect by Jan. 1, 2031, then H.B. 72 will be repealed. Therefore, although signed into law in March 2021, the substance of H.B. 72 may never actually be implemented. This further undermines the claim that Utah had \"passed a law banning pornography on cellphones,\" since the law did not actually constitute a ban, and as of yet, had no known implementation date.",

    "article_text": "Claim: A video circulating online in late summer 2025 authentically showed an adult gorilla clubbing the head of a crocodile to free a baby gorilla from its mouth. Rating: Fake About this rating In September 2025, a video that appeared to show an adult gorilla hitting a crocodile in the face with a club to free a baby gorilla from the crocodile's jaws was seen by millions across social media. A single X post ( archived ) with the caption, \"I've been cackling for 94secs,\" was viewed more than 5 million times after little more than a day and a half since it was uploaded. An edit of the video shared to TikTok ( archived ) was viewed over 7 million times. The video was also popular on Instagram ( archived ) and Reddit (archived) . I've been cackling for 94secs pic.twitter.com/P0SolynfX9 — ✨Lovely✨ (@ItsLovelyLaveau) September 3, 2025 But this was not a real video of a gorilla protecting a baby gorilla from a crocodile. The video was generated with artificial intelligence (AI). The oldest version of the video Snopes could find was this YouTube Short ( archived ) posted by the account OneMoSet on Aug. 28, 2025. The description of the video used the hashtag #ai, and a disclaimer from YouTube warned \"sound or visuals were significantly edited or digitally generated.\" The description of OneMoSet's YouTube channel was \"ai like you never seen it!\" The channel primarily posted AI-generated videos related to bodybuilding; however, many of its Shorts ( archived ) were AI-generated videos featuring gorillas. In fact, the crocodile video, titled \"Gorilla saves!,\" was the first of five videos with the \"Gorilla saves\" title. Four of those five videos featured a gorilla using a club or a bat to hit a predator attacking a person or another animal. Signs of AI-generation exist in the video itself. When the gorilla hit the crocodile in the video, the baby gorilla was not impacted by the club hitting the crocodile, even though the adult gorilla hit the crocodile where it was holding the baby in its mouth. Additionally, the baby gorilla passed through the mouth of the crocodile when the latter was hit. Pausing the video soon after impact shows that the crocodile's face collapsed in on itself or partially disappeared soon after it was hit. Finally, the baby gorilla did not have a shadow in the video, even though a shadow was clearly visible beneath the other animal s. Nile crocodiles, the largest in Africa, are opportunistic hunters that typically wait in the water to ambush prey swimming through it or approaching the edge of it, according to the World Land Trust . It is therefore theoretically possible that a crocodile could ambush a baby gorilla in an attempt to eat it and be driven off by an adult gorilla as shown in the AI-generated video. However, an interaction between the two as seen in the AI-generated video is unlikely. Nile crocodiles typically quickly grab their prey and drag them into the water in an attempt to drown them, meaning an adult gorilla would likely have little time to intervene and hit a moving target. Additionally, there is little overlap in the ranges of the two animals . It's much easier to find fictional footage of crocodiles and gorillas fighting in this way than it is to find real video. Crocodiles and gorillas are popular opponents in online arguments about which animals would win in fights, and there are numerous AI-generated and otherwise fake videos of crocodiles and gorillas fighting for whatever reason on Google ( archived ).",

We have rated this claim fake. An account with the username aithefuture4u originally posted the video to Instagram on Jan. 4, 2025. The profile is described as a video and content creator that specializes in \"AI generated videos.\" A caption that accompanied the video contained several hashtags also identifying the video as being AI-generated: \"#ai #aigenerated #aivideo #artificialintelligence #aiart #aiartcommunity.\" Aside from the cartoonlike look, the video holds several clues that it was created using AI. For starters, at the 2-second mark in the video, the man's leg moves through the railing. (Instagram/aithefuture4u) Secondly, a frame-by-frame comparison shown below shows how the bow railing morphs and changes throughout the clip. (Instagram/aithefuture4u) And at the beginning of the clip, the man has gray facial hair while at the end, he has a bare face – another indication that the video was generated using AI. (Instagram/aithefuture4u) Snopes has debunked other videos posted as authentic that were actually AI-generated, including a big-eyed jellyfish and a \"hidden tunnel\" that was supposedly found under the UnitedHealthcare CEO's home .",

As of this writing, there were over 91,000 ratings between Apple iTunes stores and Google Play from users who had used the artificial intelligence software to digitally turn their selfie or portrait into a cartoon character or Renaissance-era painting. The app was created by Wemagine.ai LLP and can be downloaded for free — but may come with a certain security cost. “We are a tight knit team of two founders, creative directors, creators and developers who are passionate about combining human's creativity and AI's capabilities to create remarkable products,” read the company’s website . A look through the app’s privacy policy revealed that potential security risks associated with its use were on par with other data-collecting platforms. As of March 1, 2021, the app’s privacy practices , which were not verified by Apple, read as follows: \"We use your data to provide and improve Service. By using Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, the terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.\" In short, though the company that operates Voilà AI Artist Cartoon Photo collects data from individual users, it is not yet known to what extent these pose security risks that are unique from other data-collecting applications. \"Some magazines [and] websites, unfortunately, went with publishing news claiming there are security risks on Voila, and as it is very important to trust the app you share and use,\" a spokesperson for Wemagine told Snopes in an email. \"While we understand the intention to keep users informed about their risk about their data, some of the writings and assumptions on how all developers will somehow misuse data can create misunderstanding and distrust from users.\" But here’s what we do know. Like many other app-hosting companies, Wemagine.ai LLP can collect personally identifiable data from users such as how long a person visits a particular page (usage data) and small files stored on a device known as cookies. Browser information, phone models and purchase history, photos uploaded from the mobile device while using the app — including those from the camera or camera roll — and their metadata may also be collected by the company. Wemagine affirms that it does not use photos and facial features for any reason other than for the portrait and editing functionality of Voilà AI Artist App. \"Regarding photos specifically, we do not collect or store them on the server, only for processing, and even for that we can't access them. They are not used in any way to do anything other than creating the cartoons or arts. Not used for further improvement or datasets as well. They are merely 'passing through' servers we use (and it's all located in the USA by google cloud) to only process the photo into cartoon or art. It's no different than any other typical 'photography' apps which do not use AI,\" said the Wemagine spokesperson. But data collected can be outsourced to other partners. For example, collected data is sometimes managed by a “data controller” — a person who can determine the purposes for which and the way any personal data are, or are going to be, processed. Information and personal data may also be transferred to and maintained at computers outside of a user’s home location in areas where data protection laws may differ. But in providing consent to the privacy policy, a user grants the company the ability to do so. And though Wemagine said that it does not sell or rent personal information to any third parties “for any purpose,” it can release personal data to law enforcement, subsidiaries of the company, contractors, and third parties who are supporting the business. “The security of your data is important to us but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure,” reads the privacy policy. “While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.” As a user, you have the right to request copies of information held by the company or require that they modify, update, or delete such information. You can also block them from using your data or limit in the way in which the company uses it. Contact voilaartist@wemagine.ai to make such requests or to withdraw consent to use personal data.",

    "claim": "Elon Musk was fired as CEO of PayPal. ",
    "rating": "Mostly True",
    "article_text": "Claim: Elon Musk was fired as CEO of PayPal. Rating: Mostly True About this rating What's True In 2000 Elon Musk was fired as CEO of X.com after it merged with software company Confinity, which featured PayPal as a service. In 2001, the company was rebranded to PayPal. What's False The company was not known as PayPal at the time of Musk’s firing. As Tesla investors worried in mid-December 2022 that CEO Elon Musk's buyout of Twitter was diverting his attention from the electric car company, especially after he sold off $3.6 billion worth of his own Tesla shares, many observers pointed to his previous challenges as the CEO of a very different company. Musk, they said, had once been the CEO of PayPal and got fired: While this claim is mostly true, it's also oversimplified. In 1999, Musk was the founder of a financial services firm called X.com. The firm was trying out a number of new technological concepts, including using email addresses to carry out financial transactions. X.com's big competitor was a startup co-founded by Peter Thiel and Max Levchin called Confinity, which was developing a similar concept known as PayPal. In March 2000, the two companies merged, but kept the X.com name. According to the book \" Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future \" by Ashlee Vance, the two merged teams could never see eye to eye: \"Musk kept championing X.com, while most everyone else favored PayPal,\" Vance wrote. The book went on to describe the actual coup to remove Musk as CEO, as complaints and questions grew about Musk's decision-making amidst numerous crises: What followed was one of the nastiest coups in Silicon Valley's long, illustrious history of nasty coups. A small group of X.com employees gathered one night at Fanny & Alexander, a now defunct bar in Palo Alto, and brainstormed about how to push out Musk. They decided to sell the board on the idea of Thiel returning as CEO. Instead of confronting Musk directly with this plan, the conspirators decided to take action behind Musk's back. Musk and Justine had been married in January 2000 but had been too busy for a honeymoon. Nine months later, in September, they planned to mix business and pleasure by going on a fundraising trip and ending it with a honeymoon in Sydney to catch the Olympics. As they boarded their flight one night, X.com executives delivered letters of no confidence to X.com's board. Some of the people loyal to Musk had sensed something was wrong, but it was too late. [...] When Musk finally heard what had happened, he hopped on the next plane back to Palo Alto. \"It was shocking, but I will give Elon this–I thought he handled it pretty well.\" Justine said. According to a 2007 Inc.com profile of Musk: \"In the fall of 2000, Musk went on a two-week trip to meet prospective investors. When he returned, he learned that Levchin and Thiel had orchestrated a coup. The board fired Musk, replaced him with Thiel, and renamed the company PayPal.\" Musk admitted to Inc.com in 2007 that he was hurt by the ouster: \"\"I buried their hatchet,\" he says, as he pantomimes pulling a blade out of his back. \"Life is too short for long-term grudges.\" Of course, it's also true that Levchin and Thiel went on to take PayPal public and make him even richer. But what Musk hasn't gotten over is the fact that the company never became more than a glorified feature, and he still believes that PayPal has the potential to become the world's largest consumer financial services company.\" Musk would later joke about the coup in an interview, saying, \"It's not a good idea to leave the office when there are a lot of major things underway which are causing people a great deal of stress.\" He added that \"rather than fight it at this critical time\" he thought it best to just concede. He discussed the ouster at the 3:36 mark in the link below: In June 2001, Thiel rebranded the company as PayPal. The ouster has been widely documented and Musk himself has talked about it, except the company he was ousted from was technically not known as PayPal, but X.com. PayPal was a service offered by the company while Musk was in charge. We thus rate this claim as \"Mostly True.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: The right-wing social media app Parler was hacked in November 2020. Rating: False About this rating On Nov. 24, 2020, a rumor started circulating on social media that the right-wing website Parler had been hacked. This rumor, which held that Parler users had their Social Security numbers and private messages stolen, was largely based on a single (since deleted) tweet and a months-old screenshot. Rumors about Parler's being hacked went viral after Twitter user @Kevinabosch posted the following message : \"I've seen what looks like legit proof of 5000 compromised Parler accounts including DM's of some well-known figures. Hackers decompiled the app, zero day exploit etc.. I wish I could unsee what I've seen.\" This claim, however, came without evidence. And as Jane Lytvynenko , a Buzzfeed reporter who monitors social media for viral misinformation, noted, this account has shared inaccurate claims on social media before. By the morning of Nov. 25, this tweet was deleted. In addition to the unfounded claim displayed above, a screenshot supposedly showing proof of the hack was also circulated on social media: This screenshot, however, is not recent. It was taken in July 2020, more than four months before the current spate of rumors. Furthermore, this screenshot comes from an old WordPress installation of Parler, not from the site's app. Tech reporter Mikael Thalen noted that while this WordPress site may have once been used for simple blog posts, like announcements about the new social media site, it did not host any user data. Parler CEO John Matze disputed the rumors that his social media site was hacked, writing that \"we do not use WordPress products, nor WordPress databases.\" As of this writing, there's no evidence to show that any user data, including Social Security numbers or private messages, were hacked from Parler. This rumor originated with a seemingly baseless claim that was subsequently propped up by a months-old screenshot. Furthermore, the CEO of the company has called all of these allegations fake. We will update this article if any additional information comes to light.",

    "claim": "WD-40 fixes glass on cracked phone screens.",
    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: WD-40 fixes glass on cracked phone screens. Rating: False About this rating Right off the bat, no, WD-40 cannot fix the glass on a cracked phone screen. It doesn't matter if it's an iPhone, Android, flip phone, or really any kind of phone. In fact, people might find more use for WD-40 on an old candlestick telephone to loosen up some of the parts for repairs than for any modern device. Courtesy: Glen Bledsoe/Flickr The idea that WD-40 can magically fix a cracked phone screen has been featured for quite some time in a number of YouTube thumbnails and online advertisements. It's also been discussed on online forums. For example, the two clickbait YouTube videos below teased thumbnails that showed WD-40 cans pointed at broken phone screens: We don't recommend these misleading videos. Neither video ended up showing how cracked phone screens can be repaired with WD-40. They simply showed that black marker can perhaps be removed from phone screens. It's unclear if accidentally marking on a phone screen with a Sharpie is a big issue in today's society. Aside from YouTube thumbnails, an April 2021 online advertisement claimed: \"The One and Only WD40 Trick Everyone Should Know.\" It also featured a photo of WD-40 pointed at a cracked phone screen: Readers who clicked on the ad were led to a 43-page story that never mentioned phones at all. We noticed that one of the ads that appeared under the story claimed that \"Hercules\" actor Kevin Sorbo died in 2020. This was false, as we previously reported . The WD-40 thumbnails and ads might remind some readers of similarly strange travel ads that we've reported on in the past. The travel ads claimed that hotel guests should \"always\" put a towel under the door . Another said guests should \"always\" place coins in the bathroom sink . These both turned out to be fairly dubious. In sum, we don't recommend turning to a can of WD-40 to fix a cracked phone screen. The best bet is to contact a local retailer or trusted website that specializes in phone repair.",

    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: A WhatsApp video message known as \"Argentina Is Doing It\" spreads malware that irreparably hacks viewers' cell phones. Rating: False About this rating In July 2020, WhatsApp users reported receiving a message that claimed a video on the platform titled \"Argentina is doing it\" was spreading malware that would hack the cell phones of people who received the media file. The warning alert looked like this: The warning alert makes several assertions: that video footage detailing Argentina's response to the coronavirus pandemic was going to start circulating online; that that video file would irreparably compromise information on viewers cell phones in 10 seconds, and that the national news outlet, CNN, had reported on the malware scheme and/or the video about Argentina. By July 16, cautionary messages about the alleged file were spreading on Twitter, as well. Numerous Snopes readers requested that we investigate the warning alert and purported video. The warning — like similarly-worded messages that have circulated on WhatsApp in recent years — appeared to be a hoax. First, we looked for evidence of the alleged video about the South American country's response to the pandemic, and whether that footage had been spreading a virus that hacks people's phones. Meanwhile, we contacted CNN to determine the legitimacy of the claim that the news outlet had reported on the scheme, or the \"Argentina is doing it\" video. Blair Cofield, a CNN spokesperson, said in an email to Snopes: \"This is false. There is nothing on CNN platforms with that message.\" In sum, it appeared that no one online actually saw or received a link to the \"Argentina is doing it\" video, per our analysis. Additionally, we searched for details to explain the extent to which the scheme removed or stole recipients' cell information, and the underlying motivation behind the warning message. We found no evidence to explain the cell operating system on which the malware runs. On a web page to explain the platform's privacy and security issues, WhatsApp says such messages that aim to deceive users often contain instructions to forward the message (\"Pass the information on to your family and friends\") and claim you can avoid punishment (getting your phone hacked) if you act in a certain way. The \"Argentina is doing it\" message checked both those boxes. The WhatsApp page goes on to say people should disregard such messages, and \"to avoid exposing your contacts to potential harm, please never forward these messages to them.\" A cybersecurity writer for Forbes wrote in March 2020: \"These hoax WhatsApp messages are the modern equivalent of the old chain letter that urged the reader to send copies on to ten people, or something terrible would happen to them. ... the real problem with this kind of hoax messaging that goes viral is that it can then turn into what it purports to be: a malware distribution tool.\" Given the fact that no evidence shows that the \"Argentina is doing it\" video exists, nor that it is part of a malware scheme to hack cell phones — as well as the similarities in language between this viral message and previous WhatsApp hoaxes — we rate this claim \"False.\"",

    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: A new AI feature on WhatsApp from Meta – the service's parent company – allows the company default access to all chats sent on the app unless users enable an “advanced privacy” option. Rating: False About this rating In August 2025, several posts across multiple platforms ( archived , archived ) claimed that a new AI feature available on the messaging platform WhatsApp meant that private messages sent and received on the app were no longer private without manually enabling an \"advanced privacy\" setting. The feature from the service's parent company, Meta, officially launched in April 2024 and was improved to summarize messages in June 2025. It allows users to chat with an AI bot that can, according to the WhatsApp website , create images, summarize unread messages, provide suggestions (for example, a restaurant everyone in a group chat can agree on) and more. One post ( archived ) about it received more than 847,600 views, as of this writing. It read: This message goes out to anyone who is in WhatsApp groups: As of today, AI is available on WhatsApp and therefore has access to all chats. You can enable the \"advanced privacy\" option. Otherwise, AIs can open group messages, see phone numbers, and even retrieve personal information from your phone... even in private chats. To prevent this: 1. Click on the bar above that says \"Advanced chat privacy enabled. More information.\" 2. Turn the \"Advanced chat privacy\" option to On. Do this as soon as possible and share it with other groups you're in. Thanks to barrister @Francis_Hoar for the generic message. (X user @JamesMelville) A search of recent posts on Francis Hoar's X page did not reveal the original message, but it's possible the claim originated with that account. The official WhatsApp X account replied to the post above ( archived ), writing: This is not true. Meta AI on WhatsApp can only read what you choose to share with it (it does not have access to all your chats or contacts). Meta AI is not 'on' until you choose to use it by messaging it directly or invoking it in an existing chat. Your personal messages on WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted by default, meaning only you and the people you chat with can read or share them. When another user followed up with a question regarding whether AI could see \"the content of the chat\" if one person uses the AI tool in a single or group chat, the official WhatsApp responded : \"nope, MetaAI can only see the actual message that you (or another person in the chat) send it, not the other messages in the chat.\" (X.com) These statements from WhatsApp are aligned with the company's public policies, which state that the \"AIs can read what is shared with them, but your personal messages remain end-to-end encrypted.\" It also clarifies that \"what you send to Meta may be used to provide you with accurate responses or to improve Meta's AI models, so don't send messages to Meta with information you don't want it to know,\" and that users also have the option to delete interactions with Meta AI. Meta's AI function on WhatsApp acts as a chat on its own where users can send messages and receive answers as well as a function that users can activate within a chat. When a WhatsApp user taps the blue circle icon to the bottom right of the app interface, the following display appears. (WhatsApp) The \"Advanced Privacy\" option the post above referenced is a real feature, but enabling it is not required to protect information not intentionally shared with the Meta AI. According to the April 2025 rollout announcement , \"w hen the setting is on, you can block others from exporting chats, auto-downloading media to their phone, and using messages for AI features\" so that \"everyone in the chat has greater confidence that no one can take what is being said outside the chat.\" The bottom line is ... Contrary to what a widely circulated post claimed, Meta's AI feature in WhatsApp does not by default \" open group messages, see phone numbers, and even retrieve personal information from your phone... even in private chats.\" According to the official WhatsApp privacy policy, the AI feature can read messages that users share with it, but personal messages remain end-to-end encrypted and therefore private. Users can also delete messages shared with the AI feature, which is an optional service that is not applied to messages by default. Enabling the \"Advanced Privacy\" function further prevents users from being able to share private information outside of a chat.",

    "claim": "A new rule will allow WhatsApp to &quot;use&quot; your photos and private posts, but you can opt out of this by posting a disclaimer.",
    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: A new rule will allow WhatsApp to \"use\" your photos and private posts, but you can opt out of this by posting a disclaimer. Rating: False About this rating A viral bit of copypasta shared repeatedly on WhatsApp has alleged two things: That a new policy will allow WhatsApp to \"use\" or \"publish\" your photos and private posts, and that if you do not want to give WhatsApp this permission, you can simply post a disclaimer barring the platform from doing so. The most popular version of this claim has been reshared many times, and appears across the internet in multiple languages : I DO NOT AUTHORIZE I DO NOT AUTHORIZE I DO NOT AUTHORIZE I DO NOT AUTHORIZE Remember, tomorrow begins the new Whatsap rule that allows you to use your photos !! Remember that the deadline is today !!! It can be used in lawsuits against you. Everything you’ve posted can be published starting today, even deleted messages. It costs nothing more than a simple copy / paste, better to be safe than to be violated. I do not give permission to Whatsap or any organization associated with Whatsap, such as faceboook, and Instagram to use my images, information, messages, photos, deleted messages, files, etc. This is real. The compartment !!!!!!! I do not authorize Share it in 10 groups and a signal like this will appear on your Whatsap: ✅ that means that your phone is protected against the new rule First of all, as an end-to-end encryption messaging service, WhatsApp does not have the ability to view or access private messages or photos. While WhatsApp released a change in their privacy policy that required business accounts to share some data with Facebook in January 2021, this policy was incorrectly interpreted to apply to private accounts, and its implementation has been delayed until May 2021. Second of all, the notion that a private user can change the existing terms of their user agreement with an internet company by simply posting a putatively legal sounding post is one of the oldest tropes of the social media age. It first appeared on Facebook in the late 2000s, and later Instagram, Snapchat , and others. As we have previously reported in those cases, nothing you post on a social media platform alters the terms of use agreement you signed by joining that platform. Because WhatsApp is not implementing policy changes allowing them to use or publish your private posts, and because a legal-sounding disclaimer does nothing to alter existing terms of service, this claim is \"False.\"",

    "article_text": "Claim: In May 2021, the multiplatform messaging app WhatsApp issued an update that changed its privacy settings to include “everyone” by default, allowing any user to add a person to a group without the person's knowing. Rating: Mostly False About this rating What's True The “everyone” setting is default and is automatically set when the application is downloaded. This has been the case since the setting was introduced in 2019. What's False The setting was not first introduced to the application in a May 2021 update. What's Undetermined It is unknown if an update issued in May 2021 reverted previously established settings to the default settings, possibly changing the setting from “my contacts” to “everyone.” After a WhatsApp update was issued in May 2021, a widely circulated warning urged users to double-check their privacy settings, as the app had supposedly reverted to a setting that allowed any user — including scammers and spammers — to add an individual to a group message without the person's permission. Specifically, it was said that WhatsApp changed its group messaging setting to include “everyone” on the app by default rather than by a user’s personal contacts. This change would allow any individual to add a person to a group message without consent. Snopes readers sent our team the below image to determine whether the claims were legitimate: We found the information about the setting was correct, but it was inaccurate to say that the setting had been \"secretly\" rolled out over night. As cybersecurity reporter and Forbes contributor Zak Doffman pointed out , the change is nothing to cause alarm. The “everyone” setting is default on the app and has been since WhatsApp introduced it back in 2019, according to a blog post at the time. This privacy setting and “invite system” allow users to individually decide who they add to groups. To change the setting, a user simply needs to go to “Settings,” then tap “Account” > “Privacy” > “Groups” and select one of three options: “Everyone,” “My Contacts,” or “My Contacts Except.” “My Contacts” means only users in a person’s address book can add the person to groups, while “My Contacts Except” provides additional control over who among your contacts can add you to a group. “In those cases, an admin who can’t add you to a group will be prompted to send a private invite through an individual chat, giving you the choice of joining the group. You'll have three days to accept the invite before it expires,” wrote the platform at the time. A look through our own settings on WhatsApp revealed that the \"everyone\" option was indeed the default when the app was downloaded, and can be changed by the following steps: As some social media users pointed out, the \"everyone\" setting could have implications for privacy, or spam concerns. \"Just like regular SMS or phone calls, it is possible for other WhatsApp users with your phone number to contact you, even if they are not in your phone address book,\" a spokesperson for WhatsApp told Snopes in an email. \"We work diligently to try to reduce any spam messages that come through our service, and treat this as an important issue. Please block anyone who is sending you unwanted messages. This will prevent the person from contacting you again and will also help us identify this number as a spammer.\" Reporting a message as spam adds the sender to a blocked list. What remains to be determined is whether the most recent app update reverts personalized settings back to their default. Snopes contacted the messaging platform for further clarification, and will update the article accordingly. WhatsApp also has resources for those hoping to learn more about blocking and unblocking contacts. Click here for Android, and here for iPhone .",

    "article_text": "Claim: WhatsApp’s new terms of service as of early January 2021 allows the messaging app to share bank account information and other data with Facebook, as well as censor private messages. Rating: Mixture About this rating What's True WhatsApp has actually been sharing user data with Facebook for years. Under the updated user agreement, which is mandatory after Feb. 8, 2021, information shared by users with businesses on the app may be shared by WhatsApp with Facebook, including financial transactions and payments, contacts list, usage data, location, phone identifiers, and various metadata. What's False There is no evidence that WhatsApp will censor private messages. WhatsApp says it will not have access to user’s private chats, groups, or call logs, and neither will Facebook. In early 2021, a pop-up on WhatsApp user’s phones alerted them to a new terms of service and privacy policy for the messaging app that set off alarm bells. The privacy policy and terms of service said that as of Feb. 8, 2021, the company’s policies would change, and users had to accept the new terms if they wanted to keep using the app. As part of the change, WhatsApp removed a passage allowing users to opt out of sharing certain data with Facebook. The policy now states , “WhatsApp receives information from, and shares information with, the other Facebook Companies. We may use the information we receive from them, and they may use the information we share with them, to help operate” and market services. This created an outcry from privacy advocates and users. The week after the announcement, millions downloaded other apps like Signal and Telegram, which, similar to WhatsApp, offer free encrypted messaging services. Our readers asked us a range of questions around this, including whether Facebook would now have access to private messages, and a range of user data that included bank account information. The answer is complicated and requires diving into WhatsApp’s new policies. Firstly, the new policy appears to apply to user interactions with businesses on the messaging platform. Will Cathcart, who oversees development and strategy for WhatsApp, said on Twitter, “This update describes business communication and does not change WhatsApp’s data sharing practices with Facebook.” WhatsApp’s new privacy policy states: Businesses you interact with using our Services may provide us with information about their interactions with you. We require each of these businesses to act in accordance with applicable law when providing any information to us. When you message with a business on WhatsApp, keep in mind that the content you share may be visible to several people in that business. In addition, some businesses might be working with third-party service providers (which may include Facebook) to help manage their communications with their customers. For example, a business may give such third-party service provider access to its communications to send, store, read, manage, or otherwise process them for the business. To understand how a business processes your information, including how it might share your information with third parties or Facebook, you should review that business’ privacy policy or contact the business directly. The update was part of Facebook’s efforts to serve more targeted ads to people on Facebook and Instagram by knowing their usage habits on WhatsApp, and let businesses receive payments on WhatsApp for items that users may have clicked on Instagram first. The company has clarified that neither WhatsApp nor Facebook will have access to private messages and media shared between users and groups. They cannot share your call logs, location, contact lists, and groups from your personal messaging. End-to-end encryption on the app remains intact, and there is no evidence the company could “censor” messages, as some of our readers were asking. They said : \"We want to be clear that the policy update does not affect the privacy of your messages with friends or family in any way. Instead, this update includes changes related to messaging a business on WhatsApp, which is optional, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data.\" What kind of information will be shared with their parent company, then? According to Cathcart, this would be information conveyed through “optional people-to-business” features. This could include location, contact lists, financial information and usage data, and other types of so-called metadata that would help Facebook target ads. Users can interact with the businesses in other ways and don’t necessarily have to use WhatsApp. Many of our readers were concerned about their financial information being shared with Facebook. It is not clear whether bank account information will be shared with the company. According to WhatsApp’s policy , users provide their financial information if they use the app’s payments features: If you use our payments services, or use our Services meant for purchases or other financial transactions, we process additional information about you, including payment account and transaction information. Payment account and transaction information includes information needed to complete the transaction (for example, information about your payment method, shipping details and transaction amount). If you use our payments services available in your country or territory, our privacy practices are described in the applicable payments privacy policy. We reached out to WhatsApp and Facebook to get more details, and they directed us back to their FAQs . As it turns out, WhatsApp has been sharing user information with Facebook since 2016. At that time, the service offered its users 30 days to opt out of at least some of the sharing. The company says it must receive user information \"to operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services” and that information depends on how we use their services. So even though our private messages are encrypted, there is still a lot of data WhatsApp can share with Facebook, and has been sharing for years from the majority of its users. We spoke to Gennie Gebhart, a privacy researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a non-profit digital rights group. \"The good news is that this is not an extreme privacy policy change,\" she said. \"The bad news is the extreme policy change already happened in 2016, all those years ago. WhatsApp is and has been sharing a lot more data with Facebook than most users were aware of [...] Facebook is correct that nothing changed because the bad stuff already happened.\" She added that WhatsApp is still a good messaging service, \"It's reliable, it's usable [...] but when Facebook acquired WhatsApp, all this wasn't on the table. All this is an erosion of the original promise [WhatsApp made]. No one asked for shopping on WhatsApp, except maybe businesses. It's moving WhatsApp to become an everything app, like WeChat [in China].\" Ultimately, Gebhart worried that connecting businesses advertising on Facebook, to conducting their transactions on WhatsApp, is collapsing the barriers between three different services: Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which has privacy implications for users. \"The best case scenario is users will freak out [and have conspiracy theories] about how Facebook is listening to everything. [But] people who separate their identities between apps, will see them merge in unpredictable ways that they have no control over [...] Activities on one app pollute what is exposed when using another.\" This new privacy policy also does not apply to WhatsApp in the European Union (EU), which has strict privacy laws. WhatsApp said any plan to share data with Facebook or other group companies would only be done once the company made an agreement with the Irish Data Protection Commission, the lead regulator for the service in Europe. On Jan. 15, 2021, after the backlash from users and privacy advocates, WhatsApp announced they would be delaying the planned update to May 15, 2021, to give users more time to review their planned changes. Given that WhatsApp users’ private messaging is still protected, but a range of other data related to business communications on the messaging platform, including financial transactions, could be shared by WhatsApp with Facebook, we rate this claim a “Mixture.”",

    "article_text": "Claim: Frozen wind turbines played a major role in Texas power outages as unusually harsh winter storms covered the region in snow and ice in February 2021. Rating: Mostly False About this rating What's True Failures of thermal power generators, which include natural gas, coal, and nuclear power, were responsible for the majority of the power shutdowns across Texas during the February 2021 storms. What's False Far from being the main culprit, wind turbine shutdowns accounted for only a fraction of the loss of electricity and power generation. Texas sustained widespread power failures in mid-February 2021, after a major and rare winter storm resulted in heavy snow, ice, and extremely low temperatures across the state. And the region’s power generating infrastructure was not prepared. On Feb. 15, 2021 , 2 million households across Texas lost power, and found themselves without any heat. The storm shut down most of the state, icing over roads, and U.S. President Joe Biden declared a federal emergency across the state. After water treatment plants sustained power outages, residents of Forth Worth received an official order to boil their water, while the city of Kyle said that it was close to running out of water. Conservatives immediately blamed the state’s reliance on renewable energy resources, particularly wind power, citing frozen wind turbines as the biggest reason why so much of the power had failed. Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson laid the main blame on wind turbines, saying : \"The windmills froze, so the power grid failed. Millions of Texans woke up Monday morning having to boil their water because with no electricity, it couldn't be purified,\" and \"The windmills failed like the silly fashion accessories they are, and people in Texas died.\" Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw tweeted that the failure of wind turbines was a major factor in the power outages: Crenshaw cited low supplies of natural gas as another reason and added , \"Had our grid been more reliant on the wind turbines that froze, the outages would have been much worse.\" He continued with, \"This raises serious concerns about the reliability of renewable-reliant power grids during extreme weather. It also raises serious concerns about the push to decommission baseload power sources like natural gas, which are more reliable than wind and are critical right now to keeping the lights on in Texas.\" Breitbart's headline , \"Half of Texas Wind Turbines Freeze, Hurting Electricity Output,\" while technically accurate , did not show the full picture. Half of the wind turbines did go offline , but power loss from that source was a mere fraction compared to the losses from natural gas, coal, and nuclear sources. In a statement to Bloomberg , Dan Woodfin, senior director for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the state’s power grid, said that while ice forced some turbines to shut down just as a brutal cold wave drove record electricity demand, that was the least significant factor in the blackouts. Woodfin also told Bloomberg that the main factors behind the power failures were frozen instruments at natural gas, coal, and nuclear facilities, as well as limited supplies of natural gas. An official with ERCOT also said on Feb. 16 that 16 gigawatts of renewable energy generation, mostly wind generation, were offline. In contrast, 30 gigawatts had been lost from thermal sources, including gas, coal and nuclear energy. By the next day that number had changed to 28 gigawatts of power from thermal sources and 18 gigawatts from renewable sources. Wind power is a significant energy source for the state, but the supply tends to ebb in winter months. It accounts for only 25% of total power generation that time of the year. Frozen turbines were still an issue for the state, because it was unprepared for the winter ice and snow. Turbines can be “ winterized ,” or made snow-ready, given that wind turbines have been operating in regions like Antarctica . Experts pointed out that many of Texas’ power generators, including natural gas plants and wind turbines, have not made the necessary upgrades to be ready for such conditions. “[...] the winterization we were doing was working, but this weather was more extreme than [past storms],” Woodfin said . “The loss of generation during the morning of Monday, after midnight, was really the part that made this a more extreme event than we had planned.” Given that wind turbines were not the main culprit in the blackouts, but were certainly a fraction of the problem, we rate this claim as “Mostly False.”",

    "article_text": "Claim: No women have signed up for the conservative dating app The Right Stuff. Rating: Unproven About this rating Fact Check Early October 2022 saw the internet light up with news and commentary about a new conservative dating app called The Right Stuff. In one example, social media users commented that women were not signing up for the app and that its users were thus heavily weighted toward men: The partisan nature of the dating site naturally has led to partisan commentary and jabs. But the bottom line is that a representative from the app told Snopes by email that it is not yet open for active use, as of this writing (on Oct. 5, 2022). So it's impossible to know what the makeup of its users will be when it does open. We acknowledge that we can't independently verify the internal data of a private company. But a spokesperson for the app told us in an email that the opposite is true, and so far the user base is skewing heavily female: The app is not open yet but the overwhelming majority (over 70%) of the users are women. We will actually be launching a campaign soon to try and attract more high quality men. The invite process seems to be working heavily in the female direction but we are looking at ways to bring more balance to the app. We reached back out to The Right Stuff asking on what date the app would be open for use and what they mean by \"high quality men,\" and haven't yet received a response. We will update this story when and if we do. Reports that the app had trouble securing female users might have originated from a Sept. 16, 2022, article published by the left-leaning politics news site The Daily Beast, which reported that those managing the app are a number of political figures associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump, and were trying to initially launch it in Washington, D.C., among Republican congressional staffers. It was being promoted by Ryann McEnany, who is the sister of Trump White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, but with little success, according to that article: Two Republican staffers in Washington, D.C., said many young conservative women have ignored McEnany’s outreach and have instead jeeringly passed around screenshots of her messages to group chats. Other Republican staffers in D.C.—the sort who boast about downing drinks at the Navy Yard watering hole Mission and claim their pronouns are “Yee” and “Haw” on their Instagram profiles—told The Daily Beast the app has an array of possible problems, like liberals masquerading as right-wingers and the awkward potential of matching them with conservative staffers they already know. “It’s all of Mitch McConnell’s staffers,” a female Republican operative said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because she still works in pro-Trump politics.

    "article_text": "Claim: NASA is installing internet on the moon. Rating: Mostly True About this rating Context NASA is indeed bringing a celestial internet of sorts to the moon, but it is not the same internet we know on Earth. The technology employs a “protocol suite” of new networking technologies for transmitting information between astronauts in space and those on Earth. Additionally, Nokia announced plans to bring LTE/4G to the moon to support communication between the lunar lander and rover. In March 2023, NASA took to Instagram to share the space agency's plans to install an internet-like network in space that will connect astronauts with researchers on Earth. View this post on Instagram A post shared by NASA Glenn (@nasaglenn) Though the notion may seem like a concept straight out of a lunar-colonizing, science-fiction flick, NASA is indeed bringing a celestial internet to the moon with help from telecommunications giant Nokia. To support the space agency's communication goals, the Finnish company also announced in 2022 plans to deploy LTE/4G communications to the lunar surface. However, this connectivity is not the same version of the internet or LTE/4G connectivity — that is, the fourth generation (or Long Term Evolution, LTE) of broadband cellular network technology — that we know and use on Earth. Both of the above-listed initiatives will support the objectives of the Artemis Mission, an initiative to establish a base camp on the moon to be launched by 2025. Here's how. Nokia To Launch LTE/4G on Moon To Facilitate Communication Between Lunar Lander and Rover In 2022, Nokia first announced plans to launch LTE/4G connectivity on the moon to establish communication between the lunar lander and rover. The technology will be incorporated with an LTE base station equipped with a \"fully integrated cellular network\" to allow the base camp lander to communicate with its lunar rover as a means to provide \"lunar surface connectivity.\" Range tests will be conducted up to a .6-mile radius between the lander and rover, to have the entire system monitored and configured from Earth eventually. Though this project supports the goals of the Artemis Mission, it is separate from NASA's newly developed space \"internet.\" NASA To Expand Its Space 'Internet' Program to Enhance Data Distribution In a news release dated March 1, 2023, NASA detailed a new tool to overcome signal disruption: a communications networking protocol called High-Rate Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) that employs a \"protocol suite\" of new networking technologies for transmitting information between astronauts in space and people on Earth. The space agency wrote: DTN automatically ensures information is delivered using a process called \"store-and-forward,\" which allows data to be forwarded as it is received or stored for future transmission if the signal becomes disrupted. Data store-and-forward capability enables internet-like concepts in space. DTN is essentially the cosmic version of the internet and is described as a \"similar concept of internet networks,\" in which space missions will begin to use optical, or laser, communication systems that allow for more data to be communicated. The technology serves as a conduit for bringing information from space to Earth. Spacecraft communicate using a series of relaying satellites that circle the planet. Experts estimate that up to 95% of that data is not transmitted back to Earth and will never be recovered. DTN builds on existing technology by employing a combination of radio frequency and laser communications to send information between spacecraft, astronauts, and potential planets. Data is modulated to be placed within the laser beam before it is transmitted between devices. The technology has been in development for over a decade, and its proof of concept was unveiled during the 2013 lunar laser demonstration, in which NASA used lasers to send an image of the Mona Lisa to the moon and back to Earth. A version of DTN is now used on the International Space Station. This transition to a more connected space internet will potentially clean up space communications for a more efficient, secure, and reliable method of communication. \"We've been working on developing DTN implementations that will revolutionize space communications by extending internet-like capabilities found on Earth into space,\" said Daniel Raible, principal project investigator, in the news release . \"High-Rate DTN is designed with speed and efficiency to keep up with the data rates of newer laser and radio frequency communications systems.\"",

Rating: Labeled Satire About this rating On June 13, 2024, X user @soren_iverson posted an image showing a purported new YouTube feature where advertisements are replayed on its platform if users look away from their phone or computer screens. The picture contained a phone with the video sharing platform open and a message on the screen reading: \"Please maintain eye contact for the duration of the ad. Since you looked away, you'll need to rewatch from the beginning. Restart ad.\" Iverson captioned the image: \"YouTube rewatch the ad if you look away.\" Iverson's post had amassed more than 15.1 million views at the time of this writing. One X user asked whether the concept was real, while another said the alleged proposal would be \"terrible.\" On TikTok, multiple content creators appeared to believe the new feature was legitimate . However, the Orwellian concept was not based in reality. Soren Iverson has previously stated multiple times on X he creates daily satirical designs. He also made the same disclaimer on his website. Because this post came from an author whose work was described as satirical, we rated this claim as \"Labeled Satire.\" According to a profile of Iverson for Business Insider in June 2023, he was a Los Angeles-based product designer at Cash App. He designed similarly satirical images, such as Gmail offering an option to file a restraining order as a reply, ChatGPT referring you to a therapist when your questions get too personal, and Apple Health indicating if a friend is lying when mentioning being sick. Snopes has addressed Iverson's quirky concepts on several occasions before. For background, here is why we sometimes write about satire/humor.",

    "article_text": "Claim: YouTube announced on its official Twitter account that it would be removing the ability to skip ads during videos. Rating: False About this rating On Oct. 27, 2022, a Reddit user posted a screenshot on the r/memes subreddit that showed a fake tweet from YouTube's official Twitter account , which read, \"We are officially removing the skip ad button. It's for the mental healths sake of our advertisers.\" To be clear, YouTube never tweeted this. The fake tweet referenced the button that is sometimes displayed on YouTube that allows users to skip the platform's ads that can appear before, during, and after videos. The title of the Reddit post was \"13/6/2024.\" This indicated that it was somewhat of a joke prediction of something that might happen in the future. The message appeared to claim that the ability to skip ads would be removed by YouTube around June 13, 2024. Fake tweet screenshots that are meant as jokes can sometimes receive shares outside of their original context, so that's one reason why we're publishing this fact check. One Reddit user asked in a comment , \"Is this real?\" The user who created the post responded, \"No, I made it up because spreading misinformation is fun.\" Another person chimed in and said, \"Thought this was real for a hot second and was mortified.\" We noticed others saying that they wouldn't be surprised if something like this happened in the future, with one person commenting, \"What's scary about this is that it is entirely possible.\" The Reddit post was locked by moderators of r/memes for violating a rule. It received nearly 20,000 points. For any readers who aren't familiar with how Reddit works, that number of points meant that it was a fairly popular post. It's certainly possible that YouTube might announce its completely removing the \"skip ad\" button or making other changes to the way people can interact with ads in the future. However, for now, users can rest easy, as this was nothing more than a fake tweet.",

    "article_text": "Claim: The restaurant review website Zomato suffered an attack that compromised 17 million users' data Rating: True About this rating What's True What's False The India-based restaurant review web site Zomato revealed on 18 May 2017 that it had been the victim of a cyber attack compromising data for millions of users. Zomato founder Deepinder Goyal and chief technology officer, Gunjan Patidar, detailed the nature of the attack in a blog post on 23 May 2017: The data downloaded as a result of this breach contained five data points for 17 million users - names, emails, numeric user IDs, usernames, and password hashes. The password hashes leak was a little more contained and impacted a subset of 6.6 million users - all the other users were using Facebook/Google for login - we don't have any password information for those accounts. Five days earlier, Patidar said in another post that users' credit card and payment information had not been affected by the data breach. The party responsible for the attack said in an interview that they reported a \"vulnerability in the company's infrastructure\" to Zomato after discovering it in 2016 but did not get the response, saying, \"It does not justify the pain I caused to them, but it is a reason.\" The hacker also reportedly posted the data for sale on a \"dark web\" site, alongside a sample of around 50 accounts. The tech blog Motherboard confirmed that the data was likely legitimately connected to Zomato users, since it could not create new accounts on the site using the email addresses listed on the sample. According to Goyal and Patidar, the hacker grabbed information belonging to a developer that was leaked online as a result of a separate breach against the Lithuanian company 000WebHost in October 2015. But Patidar later described the hacker as \"very cooperative\": He/she wanted us to acknowledge security vulnerabilities in our system and work with the ethical hacker community to plug the gaps. His/her key request was that we run a healthy bug bounty program for security researchers. According to Patidar, the hacker agreed to \"destroy all copies of the stolen data and take the data off the dark web marketplace\" in exchange for Zomato introducing a \"bug bounty program,\" through which it can reward users who point out security vulnerabilities in their website. He and Gupta also said that they would collaborate with other Indian online companies on improving their security capabilities.",

    "rating": "False",
    "article_text": "Claim: Zoom allows hosts of meetings, such as educators, to hear participants whose microphones are turned off. Rating: False About this rating In early 2021, Snopes became aware of viral TikTok videos that alleged school administrators or teachers could use a special Zoom feature that allowed them to hear students even when their computer microphones appeared to be turned off or muted. Over the course of months, TikTok user @ shokshooter posted a series of videos perpetuating the conspiracy theory, including footage that he framed as interactions between him and teachers on the video chatting service with his account's \" mute \" feature turned on. By enabling the mute setting, Zoom users are supposed to be able to block all in-person audio or background noise from interrupting the virtual get-together. The TikTok user, whose identity remained unknown, posted a video on Feb. 10 that alleged he had the below-displayed Zoom conversation with someone he claimed to be his teacher while his microphone was supposedly turned off. Alleged teacher: Are you still here? @shokshooter: Yeah. Alleged teacher: Did you need something? @shokshooter: You know I'm muted obviously, right? Alleged teacher: I can't discuss that. @shokshooter: OK, well you do. Can you tell me how that works, because it kind of seems fishy? Alleged teacher: I have another class I need to get to. We can discuss this another time. The TikTok user framed his videos as evidence of some kind of program or feature that allows authority figures such as teachers to secretly listen in on Zoom users whose computer screens showed a red line through a microphone symbol in the corner, supposedly meaning their microphones are \"muted.\" The alleged teacher in the Feb. 10 video remained unknown. We reached out to @shokshooter's TikTok and Instagram accounts — both of which display the moniker \"Mic Mute Man\" — to discuss the allegations he made in the videos, but we have not received a response. We will update this report when or if we do. To investigate the underlying claim, however, we sought any evidence of a feature or application that allowed certain Zoom users to hear all meeting participants, regardless of their microphone or audio settings. A web page on Zoom's Help Center, an online hub to help users navigate the program, read: As the host or co-host in a meeting, you can manage your participants, including muting and unmuting participants to manage background noise and distractions. All participants can also mute or unmute themselves, unless the host has prevented them from unmuting. Due to privacy and security reasons, the host cannot unmute other participants without their consent. The host can either use the Ask All to Unmute option, which will prompt every user to unmute themselves, or can schedule the meeting with Request permission to unmute participants enabled, which will prompt the participants for pre-approval to be unmuted by the host. In other words, the video chatting service gives hosts (the users who schedule the virtual meetings and invite others to join) the authority to determine how all other participants can use their microphones. The hosts can turn people's mics off — muting them — involuntarily, or they can choose options that allow participants to decide the audio setting for themselves throughout the meeting. So while the technology allows teachers, presumably hosts of Zoom classes, to mute students, the web service's guidelines explicitly state that such users cannot unmute participants without their approval first, due to laws governing communication privacy. Let us note here: At the start of, or throughout, meetings, hosts can turn people's mute setting off — allowing their voice or background noise to be heard — only if the participant previously granted consent for that action. See the below-displayed example of that question to Zoom users, which Snopes obtained via its Help Center. In the viral TikTok videos, however, the narrator not only alleged the presumed hosts of his Zoom meetings unmuted him against his will, but also that his view of the video chatting service showed his microphone turned off. We reached out to Zoom to ask if it offered any features or programs to which users could subscribe that enabled them to hear meeting participants whose screens showed them muted. Matt Nagel, a spokesperson for the company, responded to our question via email: The answer is no, and it's unfortunate that people appear to be fabricating video footage and spreading misinformation to the contrary. Zoom takes security and privacy very seriously. We do not offer the ability, or a separate plan, other software, or any other means to secretly unmute and listen to others. In sum, while the exact motivation or circumstances of @shokshooter's videos remained unknown — they could have been prerecorded Zoom meetings that he framed as live interactions with teachers, or he may have used mute-unmute keyboard shortcuts and video editing to make his claim — their allegations were not true.",

    "article_text": "Claim: Mark Zuckerberg begged Elon Musk to buy Facebook while begging forgiveness for the company’s past mistakes. Rating: Labeled Satire About this rating In late January 2023, an article on website SpaceXmania.com claimed that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg begged Twitter CEO Elon Musk to buy Facebook from him. This story is labeled as satire. The article headline stated , \"Breaking: Mark Zuckerberg begs Elon Musk to buy Facebook,\" with the subtitle \"'Forgive me mighty Elon' – Said Zuckerberg.\" The story goes on to claim that Zuckerberg posted a tearful video on his personal Facebook page in which he begged forgiveness for the company's past mistakes and appealed to Musk to save the company from its downfall. The article described their alleged interaction which resulted in Zuckerberg agreeing to become Musk's butler: \"I know we've made mistakes, but I truly believe that with Elon at the helm, we can turn Facebook around and make it the great platform it once was,\" Zuckerberg said in the video. According to sources close to the situation, Zuckerberg has been struggling to keep the company afloat in the face of increasing competition from newer, more innovative social media platforms. [...] But in an unexpected move, Musk took to Twitter to respond to Zuckerberg's plea, saying \"I'll do it, but only if you agree to be my personal butler for a year. Deal?\" Many were stunned by Musk's response, with some speculating that the offer was a thinly veiled attempt to humiliate Zuckerberg. Despite the harsh terms, Zuckerberg reportedly agreed to the deal and was last seen packing his bags for a move to Musk's California mansion. This story is labeled satire on the website and a note at the bottom of the article states, \"This is Satire and not real news.\" The two moguls have feuded in the past. Back in 2016 , a SpaceX rocket explosion destroyed one of Facebook's satellites, resulting in Zuckerberg releasing a statement expressing his \"deep disappointment.\" After Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, Musk made a public show of deleting SpaceX and Tesla's pages on the platform, saying Facebook gave him \"the willies.\" However, their rivalry has not resulted in anything as drastic as Zuckerberg begging forgiveness and trying to sell Musk his company.",

    "article_text": "Claim: In 2003, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg stole the program from a classmate, Chris Hughes. Hughes went missing not long after, and Zuckerberg passed off Facebook as his own invention. Rating: False About this rating On Jan. 7, 2025, Meta, the social media company that owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, announced it was ending its fact-checking program by switching to a system like X's Community Notes. In the wake of the announcement, posts appeared on Facebook claiming that while at Harvard University, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg stole the program that would eventually become Facebook from a classmate, Chris Hughes. According to the posts, Hughes went missing not long after and has not been heard from since. Snopes readers wrote in to ask whether the claim was true. (Facebook Page No Astronauts Allowed) The claim is false. To start, Hughes did not go missing in 2003 — he was a part of Facebook until 2007, when he left to work for then-presidential candidate Barack Obama, according to Forbes and Vox . He sold most of his stake in the social media giant by 2012 and has since said he believes Facebook should be broken up. Additionally, there was no public evidence to support the claim that Zuckerberg stole Facebook from Hughes. In 2008 , Zuckerberg did settle a lawsuit with three other Harvard students, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and Divya Narendra, who claimed Zuckerberg stole the idea and code for Facebook from them, but Hughes was not a party in that lawsuit. The fact that the claim featured some elements of truth — Hughes did play a crucial role in the early days of Facebook and Zuckerberg was accused of stealing the idea for Facebook by other Harvard students — mixed with incorrect information may have led to people believing it was true. However, the post concluded with what might be taken as a tongue-in-cheek note that it was intended to be satire: \"The story was hushed up until today, when Facebook decided to no longer fact-check posts for accuracy.\"",
