A photograph surfaced on X (formerly Twitter), allegedly showing the storm's impact on a highway.\n\nAccording to the X post, the cold drained power from several electric vehicles' batteries and so their owners abandoned them, causing major roadblocks. The post claimed (we translated it from Italian):\n\nMany highways in Germany are blocked due to electric vehicles running out of power in the cold. Even normal cars are stuck between electric vehicles, they cannot get around empty vehicles. Similar problems are also seen in the Czech Republic.\n\n(X user @elena_bardet1)\n\nThat was a false caption for the photo. In reality, it depicted a snow storm in Chicago more than a decade earlier, in February 2011, according to The Associated Press' archives. For that reason, we rated this claim Miscaptioned. (The feature image for this article depicts the same winter scene from a slightly different angle, courtesy of Getty Images.)\n\nTo come to that conclusion, we conducted a reverse-image search . TinEye's results showed the photo had been shared online almost 800 times since 2011. With various captions, the posts included memes and stories, such as a 2021 article in Arabic that claimed the photo was captured in Texas. Meanwhile, another Arabic-language article claimed it was captured in Pakistan. On Facebook alone, the image appeared in posts written in Hungarian , Italian , and Polish , in total gaining over 100,000 reactions.\n\nIn December 2023, however, the photo helped spread the in-question claim — that a recent winter snow storm in Germany caused electric vehicles to fail and create highway roadblocks. For instance, the photo was shared in a Russian-language article with the title,\"It was in the cold that electric cars ran out of charge on the highways in Germany.\" Another post on X, authored in Russian, claimed , \"This is not footage from a movie about the apocalypse, this is Germany. Electric cars that have discharged in the cold stand idle.\"\n\nFurthermore, a post in Ukrainian with the photo read, \"They write that due to bad weather, many autobahns in Germany were blocked due to electric vehicles running out of charge in the cold.\" Around the same time, another post with the image went viral, gaining more than 3 million views and calling electric vehicles \"the biggest scam the world has ever seen.\"\n\nBased on our research, there were no credible reports about electric vehicles being abandoned in December 2023 snow storms in Germany, or anywhere else.\n\nTo determine the photo's origins , we turned to Alarmy, an online stock-photo website. It hosted the image and captioned the scene as \"hundreds of cars [...] stranded on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago\" on Feb. 2, 2011.\n\nNext, we looked for news stories about the 2011 storm in Chicago, with the goal of finding one that published the in-question photo. On Minnesota Public Radio's website, for instance, we found the photo attached to a story titled, \"Massive storm paralyzes cities as it rolls east.\"\n\n(https://www.mprnews.org/)\n\nBy looking at that photo's caption, we learned the photo belonged to The Associated Press — that is, a photojournalist with that news outlet captured it. We turned to the Associated Press' archives, which confirmed the photograph was taken on Feb. 2, 2011, by one of its photographers in Chicago. The photo's description read:\n\nFILE - In this Feb. 2, 2011 file photo, hundreds of cars are seen stranded on Lake Shore Drive Wednesday, Feb. 2, 2011 in Chicago. A winter blizzard of historic proportions wobbled an otherwise snow-tough Chicago, stranding hundreds of drivers for up to 12 hours overnight on the city's showcase lakeshore thoroughfare and giving many city schoolchildren their first ever snow day. A year later temperatures are in the mid 50's and flirting with record highs for this date. (AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato,File)\n\nOther news outlets, such as ABC Chicago, reported on the Chicago snow storm in February 2011, saying that hundreds of vehicles were abandoned:\n\nMotorists and their passengers were caught on Lake Shore Drive for hours before they opted to evacuate or officials told them to evacuate. They had been trapped by accidents ahead of them and traffic behind during the worst of the snow storm.\n\nThere was no evidence to confirm, or deny, whether any vehicles in the photo were electric powered.", "article_links": ["https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rating/miscaptioned", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/02/snow-chaos-southern-germany-munich-airport-suspends-flights", "https://twitter.com/elena_bardet1/status/1731337205509960191", "https://www.snopes.com/articles/400681/how-to-perform-reverse-image-searches/", "https://tineye.com/search/73c1e78f9bcec04d27f7f85257f3a2c5dcca31c1?sort=crawl_date&order=asc&page=1", "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2LGSwuXcAEcEYN.jpg", "https://www.ypagency.net/340160", "https://www.al-madina.com/article/768675/%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%AD-%D8%B7%D8%B1%D9%82-%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%83%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D9%84%D9%88%D8%AC-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86", "https://www.facebook.com/jovasart.hu/photos/a.166120930751703/911949216168867/?type=3", "https://www.facebook.com/INFOSTRADAPOLFAN/photos/a.554821277870046/5054307484588047/?type=3", "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=868925441272357&id=100044647264306&set=a.576036723894565", "https://dnepr-news.ru/society/2023/12/03/40055.html", "https://twitter.com/Po4wKdKhuP1FRuG/status/1731354112489365746", "https://uk.tgstat.com/channel/@OpenUkraine/55841", "https://twitter.com/Real_AnTheFacts/status/1732304780955943390", "https://www.alamy.com/file-in-this-feb-2-2011-file-photo-hundreds-of-cars-are-seen-stranded-on-lake-shore-drive-in-chicago-global-warming-is-rapidly-turning-america-the-beautiful-into-america-the-stormy-sneezy-and-dangerous-according-to-a-new-federal-scientific-report-climate-changes-assorted-harms-are-expected-to-become-increasingly-disruptive-across-the-nation-throughout-this-century-and-beyond-the-national-climate-assessment-concluded-tuesday-the-report-emphasizes-how-warming-and-its-all-too-wild-weather-are-changing-daily-lives-even-using-the-phrase-climate-disruption-as-another-way-of-saying-g-image519358584.html?irclickid=2X9XpfU8sxyPT7fzlvSZkx8MUkH0upXLx0xI2c0&utm_source=77643&utm_campaign=Shop%20Royalty%20Free%20at%20Alamy&utm_medium=impact&irgwc=1", "https://www.mprnews.org/story/2011/02/02/big-winter-storm-midwest", "https://newsroom.ap.org/editorial-photos-videos/detail?itemid=4afb37b3725b4761bd327fde868ec98c&mediatype=photo", "https://abc7chicago.com/archive/7934385/"], "image_urls": ["https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/200/https:/media.snopes.com/2023/05/fake_icon.png", "https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/600/https:/media.snopes.com/2023/12/elena_bardet1_germany_highway.png", "https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/600/https:/media.snopes.com/2023/12/httpswwwmprnewsorg_chicago_pic.png"]}

The hack has also been shared in outlets like The New York Times and on social media .\n\nBut why does it work? As it turns out, there's a different YouTube video featuring a physicist explaining that.\n\nTo make a long story short, holding the key fob to your your head turns it into a temporary antenna, taking whatever signal was present and amplifying it. This works because of how water interacts with electric fields — and especially nicely with heads because of how much water they contain ( around 73% , according to Healthline).\n\nAn experiment conducted by a user on the Physics StackExchange forum was able to further clarify the best position for the key fob: pressed up against the temple of the head.

{"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/acetone-deaf/", "title": "Does Adding Acetone to Gasoline Improve Gas Mileage?", "author": "Barbara Mikkelson", "publish_date": "June 12, 2007", "claim": "Adding acetone to gasoline in an effort to improve gas mileage is a good idea.", "rating": "False", "article_text": "About this rating\n\nAs fuel prices go up, so does interest in various products and additives said to improve gas mileage. One of these is acetone, a widely-available solvent better known to most of us as nail polish remover. According to some, adding a few ounces of this chemical compound to a tank of gasoline will dramatically increase mileage, supposedly by assisting in the vaporization of fuel.\n\nOne such example of this claim was collected via email in 2007:\n\nI have heard that adding small amounts of pure acetone to your gas can increase car mileage between 15% and 30%. Is this true? I did some further research and it appears that it enables more of the gas to burn thus increasing mileage. Are there any concerns for the engine? Any input would be appreciated.\n\nAlthough various claims have been made about acetone improving gas mileage by 25% or 30%, those avowals never seem to hold up to independent scrutiny: properly controlled experiments designed to measure the ballyhooed improvement fail to recognize any significant change.\n\nCurious motorists working in less controlled settings do at times seem to note an acetone-assisted improvement, yet their results are likely better chalked up to careless measurement or miscalculation, as their findings can't be reproduced in the lab. Confusing matters further is the issue that determining the effect of anything upon gasoline mileage is a bit more difficult to work out than it would seem, because so many different factors can affect the results. The same amount of fuel will produce different gas mileages on different days, depending upon variables such as the type of automobile, the weather conditions, whether the car's air conditioning was running, how fast the vehicle was driven, etc. Eliminating the effects of each of these factors from the computation is generally beyond the abilities of the average car owner with a passing interest in knowing how many miles to the gallon his pride and joy is getting.\n\nWere the decision of adding or not adding acetone to one's fuel tank merely a question of whether the practice boosted gasoline performance, that would be one thing, but unfortunately there are other issues to consider, such as the harm that the solvent can work on vehicles. Acetone is corrosive, which means it can eat away at rubber components such as gaskets and O-rings — a particularly bad result for cars with rubber hoses in their fuel lines.\n\nAcetone will also eat the paint off of a car. As Tom of Car Talk noted in January 2006:\n\nHere's our final reason not to use [acetone]: It dissolves paint. So if you slip and spill a little bit outside your fuel filler door, you'll have a nice, unpainted line running down to the bottom edge of your rear quarter panel. When we see you drive by, we'll know you didn't take our advice!\n\nAdditional information:\n\nSources\n\nAllen, Mike. \"Drive It Forever.\" The Boston Globe. 17 September 2006 (p.

A Reddit post claimed that the city of Toyota in Japan was named after the company, and not the other way around, because of the car manufacturer’s success. Originally the city was called Koromo, but the name was changed in 1959.\n\nA number of sources echoed and confirmed this information. A 2020 Reuters article states, “Toyota Motor Corp’s headquarters are in Aichi Prefecture, at Toyota City, which was named after the company in the 1950s to reflect its role as the biggest employer in the region.”\n\nThe New York Times also reported in 2019 that the city was “Once known as Koromo [...] a traditional agricultural and silk production hub before its transformation into a manufacturing powerhouse.” The report added that the city of 420,000 people is “home to the auto manufacturer from which [it] takes its name.”\n\nWhat does the city itself say about this? According to their official tourism website :\n\nToyota City in central Aichi Prefecture is a vibrant mix of traditions and technology, of state-of-the-art research and industry facilities, and areas of abundant pristine nature and fascinating history. In actual fact, Toyota City didn’t exist before taking the name of the regions biggest employer in 1959. Prior to that, the ancient township was known as Koromo, and ruled over by the Miyake and Naito clans from the sturdy Koromo Castle. Now, thanks to Toyota Motor Corporation, currently the world’s 9th largest company by revenue, and one of the world’s largest vehicle manufacturers, there is a little bit of Aichi in every corner of the world.\n\nAccording to Toyota UK magazine , the oldest Toyota factory, Honsha Plant, was built in this city along with other plants. Toyota-Global.com , an official website for the Toyota Motor Corporation, which details more about the company’s history, pointed out that it was originally called the Koromo Plant, and was renamed Honsha Plant in August 1960: “The name change was also a reflection of the fact that the name of the city in which the plant was located had been renamed from Koromo City to Toyota City in January 1959.”\n\nAccording to a 2015 AFP article , around 70,000 people were working for Toyota in the area, and many of their parents and grandparents also relied on the company for jobs. Around 40 percent of local employees worked in the autos sector. The AFP pointed out that the name change in the fifties was “a controversial move at the time.”\n\nThe mayor of Toyota City, Toshihiko Ota, emphasized to AFP that the city was about more than the car company. \"It is true that this is the city of the car—the name speaks for itself—but that isn't everything,\" he said. \"We are the leading producer of rice in Aichi prefecture and we also grow grapes and pears. Toyota City has many faces, which is sometimes masked by cars.\"\n\nA common phrase highlighted the dependence of the locals on the company, especially after the 2008 financial crash which resulted in thousands of layoffs: \"When Toyota coughs, the whole city catches a cold.” And even after the recovery , as the city gained more schools, hospitals, and municipal projects they were largely sponsored by Toyota.\n\nA 2010 report by TIME Magazine showed the company's deep influence in the area:\n\nThe residents were so proud of Toyota that in 1959 they changed the city's then name, Koromo, to match its most important citizen. But the town's fortunes rise and fall with Toyota's. The firm's sprawling factory complexes lie only a short distance from the town center, and, as in any company town, the paychecks of Toyota employees are the main source of support for its restaurants and shops. [...]\n\nToyota City already gives an impression of a town under siege. Toyota's giant headquarters building is inaccessible — like a fortress at war. A spokesman for the city wouldn't grant TIME an interview with officials, saying the government won't comment on the issues of one company. Toyota employees are keeping their lips tightly sealed as well. Those approached on the streets, their Toyota company IDs clearly visible, politely bow their heads and say they are unable to comment. Only one young employee, who wouldn't give his name, mutters, \"We're not sure what is going to happen.\"\n\nUltimately, the car manufacturer's ties in the town go deep, from impacting its economic life all the way to its name.\n\nAnd they have not stopped there. In 2020 , the company announced plans to build a \"prototype city\" of the future on a 175-acre site at the base of Mt. Fuji in Japan.\" Calling it the \"Woven City,\" they announced it will be like a \"living laboratory\" and \"powered by hydrogen fuel cells.\"", "article_links": ["https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rating/true", "https://www.redditmedia.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ur3j9o/til_that_toyota_is_headquartered_in_the_city_of/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share", "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-japan-aichi/japanese-governor-pledges-support-for-toyota-suppliers-as-production-dips-idUSKCN2251O4", "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/travel/toyota-city-rugby-world-cup.html", "https://www.tourismtoyota.jp/en/about/", "https://mag.toyota.co.uk/toyota-honsha-plant-progressing-to-zero-emissions/", "https://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/text/entering_the_automotive_business/chapter1/section1/item1.html", "https://www.businessinsider.com/afp-toyota-city-symbol-of-japans-auto-rise-2015-5", "https://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1963322,00.html", "https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/31171023.html"], "image_urls": ["https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/200/https:/media.snopes.com/2018/03/rating-true.png"]}

The estimate was significantly higher than the standard cost for a hybrid car battery replacement.\n\nOn Aug. 25, 2022, a picture was tweeted that appeared to show a nearly $30,000 repair estimate or invoice for the parts and labor needed for a hybrid car battery replacement for a Chevy Volt. The estimate was dated just two days before the tweet was posted and showed the company name Roger Dean Chevrolet, which is located in Cape Coral, Florida. (Note: The estimate was for a Volt, not the similarly named Bolt.)\n\nOur readers asked us if the estimate was real. We contacted the dealership and received confirmation that it was genuine. At the same time, we learned that this price was far from the standard cost of a hybrid car battery replacement.\n\nThe Back the Truck Up blog reported that it was the first website to confirm the authenticity of the estimate, publishing that it was priced for a 2012 Chevy Volt. This meant that the car was more than a decade old. General Motors (GM) discontinued the line of Volt vehicles in 2019.\n\nThe Volt and other hybrid vehicles function with two batteries . The part that was quoted for replacement was the more expensive one: the hybrid battery. Before labor and other costs, the hybrid battery was listed in the estimate as costing $26,853.99.\n\nCurrently, most hybrid batteries cost around $2,000 to $8,000 and can last up to 15 years or between 100,000 and 150,000 miles. The other battery in hybrid vehicles is a more standard one that powers the vehicle's electronics. It typically costs far less.\n\nBy phone, a spokesperson for Roger Dean Chevrolet told us that the replacement hybrid battery that was quoted in the estimate was not manufactured by GM and was provided for the discontinued Volt by a third-party supplier.\n\nOn Aug. 29, a page manager for the Roger Dean Chevrolet Facebook page commented about the estimate and said that the dealership did not set the price of the battery:\n\nThis is an estimate for a 12 year old vehicle out of warranty and for a battery that is extremely hard to get, due to the older technology of the 12 year old vehicle. The dealership does not set battery prices. In the newer EV or EUV vehicles with newer technology the batteries do cost less. Think of it like big screen TVs. Remember when the first big screen came out, they were very expensive, and as the technology advanced the prices became better. This battery is also out of warranty of 8yr/100k miles whatever hits first.\n\nThe Back the Truck Up blog published that the third-party supplier associated with the estimate was Spear Power Systems (SPS), \"a maker of specialty lithium battery packs.\" It's unclear if this specific part differed significantly from another listing for a Volt hybrid battery that Reddit users found for around $6,900.\n\nWe reached out to SPS to independently confirm that they were the quoted supplier. We also asked several questions about the product. This story will be updated if we receive a response.\n\n\"Being an 'antique,' the Volt battery can fetch a high price tag,\" reported the Back the Truck Up blog. \"We all know how high classic car parts can be on the third-party market.\"\n\nIn sum, yes, the hybrid battery replacement estimate for the 2012 Chevy Volt was real. At the same time, this price was significantly higher than the standard cost for a new hybrid car battery.", "article_links": ["https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rating/true", "https://twitter.com/odonnell_r/status/1562846628503261185", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/electric-vehicle-batteries/", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/coal-powered-electric-cars/", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/electric-cars-abandoned-france/", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/california-electric-cars-charge/", "https://www.snopes.com/tag/electric-vehicles/", "https://www.snopes.com/tag/twitter/", "https://backthetruckup.com/30000-invoice-is-real/", "https://shift.com/articles/chevy-volt-reliability-is-buying-a-used-chevy-volt-worth-it", "https://m.greenway-battery.com/news/Chevy-Volt-Battery-Life-Expectancy--Replacing-Cost-and-Degradation-1289.html", "https://www.beechmonttoyota.com/service/service-tips-tricks/hybrid-battery-cost/", "https://www.facebook.com/rogerdeanchevycc/photos/a.399578123446972/8017022791702429/?comment_id=745430773424795", "https://www.gmpartsonline.net/oem-parts/gm-battery-assembly-20979876", "https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/wxpi35/volt_battery_replacement_30k/"], "image_urls": ["https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/200/https:/media.snopes.com/2018/03/rating-true.png"]}

None of the pages mentioned anything about car grab handles. It was nothing more than clickbait.\n\nAs for the TikTok video, we quickly found it after a simple Google search. However, the video , which was uploaded in 2020, did not show a \"hidden purpose\" or a \"hack\" for car grab handles. It simply appeared to show that some cars have small flaps that allow access for mechanics to replace the handles. Quite a few TikTok commenters said that they tried pulling the flaps back in their cars, but ended up breaking some of the pieces off.\n\nThe main purpose of car grab handles is to help people climb into and out of the vehicle, also referred to as ingress and egress. (It's also often been referred to online as the \" oh shit \" or \"oh no\" handle that passengers might grab in panic situations, either in movies or reality.)\n\nIn 1997, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram published that the reason for a car's \"overhead grab handles\" was \"to help passengers get in and out.\" We found the same purpose mentioned for the car handles in a 2010 story from the Spokane, Washington, newspaper, The Spokesman-Review.\n\nSome drivers might also hang clothes from the grab handles if a hook is not included with the car.

Clicking the ad led us to a 51-page slideshow article that never mentioned anything about the subject. No explanation was provided because coins weren't being wedged into car door handles at all. The idea for the misleading ad appeared to be spun out of a years-old, debunked urban legend that said criminals were using coins to more easily break into vehicles.\n\n\"If You See a Coin in Your Car Door Handle, Here's What It Means.\" This was the way an advertisement was displayed online in early June 2022. However, this was nothing but misleading clickbait.\n\nThe ad, which was hosted by the RevContent advertising platform, showed a picture of a coin wedged into a car door handle.\n\nThis clickbait ad led to a 51-page slideshow article that never once mentioned anything about wedging a coin in a car door handle.\n\nWe spotted the ad being displayed under articles on at least one popular political blog. As we've noted before, publishers have the ability to select ad categories for the ads that will appear on their websites. They can also choose to block others. However, it's unusual for publishers to pick and choose specific ads to run on their websites. In other words, staff for the aforementioned popular political blog likely did not specifically choose the misleading ad to display on their website.\n\nWe clicked the ad that promised to reveal why a coin might be found wedged into a car door handle. The ad led to a 51-page slideshow article that was hosted on both Definition.org and YourBump.com . The headline on both articles read, \"These Car Hacks are Huge Lifesavers.\"\n\nWhat followed this introduction were 50 additional pages of \"car hacks\" that supposedly might serve as helpful tips for some drivers. We clicked through all of the pages. The word \"coin\" was never mentioned even once.\n\nOne of the \"car hack\" pages mentioned \"loose change,\" but had nothing to do with the meaning behind a coin in a car door handle. The page read: \"Pick up some silicone cupcake wrappers and slip them into your car's cupholders. They'll keep all that loose change organized, and are easy to remove and clean, keeping the cup holders pristine.\"\n\nCar doors were mentioned in the lengthy slideshow article. However, again, nothing was mentioned about why a coin might be found in a car door handle. One of the pages said to \"cut a pool noodle in half\" and to stick the pool noodle on a wall in the garage to prevent damage when opening the car door. Another one advised to use hand sanitizer to de-ice car door keyholes, which was also mentioned by a Ford car dealership in Michigan.\n\nAll of this talk about coins and car door handles might feel a bit familiar to some of our longtime readers. There's a reason for that.\n\nIn 2016, we published a fact check about a similar rumor. It claimed that criminals were wedging coins in car door handles as a way of breaking into vehicles. The rumor had been making the rounds on Facebook and perhaps other social media platforms since at least 2015.\n\nIn the end, we found that this was nothing more than a baseless bit of scarelore that wasn't anything to worry about. We previously covered a number of other false rumors that also involved objects being attached or placed on cars. As for coins, we even once found a strange ad about placing some loose change in a hotel bathroom sink .\n\nIn sum, no, the ad did not reveal anything about the meaning behind a coin being wedged into a car door handle.

The caption claims, semi-accurately, that he was arrested for jumping a red light and driving without a license. (According to the Albuquerque police, he failed to stop at a stop sign.)\n\nGates himself addressed the arrest that led to that mugshot in an interview with Time Magazine in 2007:\n\nThere's a great photo of Bill Gates from 1977, the year he would have graduated from Harvard if he hadn't dropped out. He was 22 at the time and looks all of 16. He's got a flowered collar, tinted glasses and feathered blond hair, and he looks so happy, you'd swear he knew what the rest of his life was going to be like. He also has a sign around his neck: it's a mug shot. \"I was out driving Paul [Allen]'s car,\" Gates says, flashing that same smile 30 years later. \"They pulled me over, and I didn't have my license, and they put me in with all the drunks all night long. And that's why the rest of my life, I've always tried to have a fair amount of cash with me. I like the idea of being able to bail myself out.\"\n\nWhile Time says he was 22, articles from 1998 put his age as 21 at the time of his arrest. According to a 1998 Associated Press story, the same mugshot was featured on the cover of Brill’s Content magazine as part of a story about Microsoft’s public relations machine. According to the AP article (which cites the Albuquerque police), the 1977 arrest was for running a stop sign and driving without a license. Gates had also been arrested in 1975 for speeding and driving without a license.\n\nGates himself reportedly first saw the photograph when representatives of the city of Albuquerque asked him if they could release it to Brill’s Content. He also showed it at a May 1998 speech, which many said was a preemptive attempt at damage control.\n\nGiven that Gates himself and The Associated Press both addressed the circumstances of the arrest, we rate this claim as “True.”", "article_links": ["https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rating/true", "https://www.instagram.com/p/CcMZzahg3FC/", "https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1630564-1,00.html", "https://www.newspapers.com/clip/99976411/the-times-recorder/", "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2022/04/clip_99976411.jpeg"], "image_urls": ["https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/200/https:/media.snopes.com/2018/03/rating-true.png", "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2022/04/clip_99976411.jpeg"]}

One version of the ad was posted and discussed on Reddit . It read: \"[City]: Unsold SUVs Now Almost Being Given Away: See Prices.\" A variation said: \"Surplus 2021 SUVs Now Almost Being Given Away: See Prices.\"\n\nWe tracked down the origins of this picture.\n\nThe way that the \"unsold 2020 SUVs\" ad worked was that it would fill in the reader's city name, likely based on IP address. It placed that location at the beginning of the ad and likely made some people believe that it was a special deal just for their town. We previously reported that the same city name tactic was used in an ad about a man finding a gold mine in a \"weird cave.\"\n\nWe clicked the ad to see where it would take us. It led to a page on mysearches.net which showed seven pictures of cars that were purportedly going for incredible prices. One of them with the same picture from the \"unsold 2020 SUVs\" ad read: \"2021 SUVs Crossovers Best Prices.\"\n\nIt's likely that these other pictures also appeared in similar online ads.\n\nHowever, clicking any of these seven pictures simply opened a search on Yahoo.com that looked for cars that were for sale. There was no evidence that it led to any real \"unsold 2020 SUVs\" that were \"almost being given away,\" as promised by the ad.\n\nThe photograph of the white SUVs that was featured in the ad originally came from old news stories from Iran. According to Parto News Agency and Iranian Students' News Agency , the picture showed a portion of more than 12,000 cars that arrived in Iran but were held at a depot due to an import ban. It's unclear when exactly the \"unsold 2020 SUVs\" photograph from the ad was captured, but the news of the ban appeared to go back to at least 2016.\n\nOn May 3, 2016, Reuters reported that the country had placed a ban on American cars. It published: \"Iran has banned the import of Chevrolet cars, a week after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei criticized imports of U.S. autos and asked the government to support domestic production.\" This perhaps left the thousands of cars stuck at the depot in customs that eventually resulted in the photograph being shot of the white SUVs.\n\nIn sum, the \"unsold 2020 SUVs\" ad that promised the vehicles were \"almost being given away\" was misleading and simply led to Yahoo search results.", "article_links": ["https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rating/false", "https://www.snopes.com/tag/arbitrage-ad-scams/", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/waukesha-suv-parade-darrell-brooks/", "https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/rdmu6k/seen_this_ad_several_times_but_i_cant_find_any/", "https://www.snopes.com/tag/reddit", "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2022/02/unsold-suvs-given-away-ad.jpg", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/man-finds-gold-mine/", "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2022/02/mysearches-unsold-suvs-page.jpg", "https://www.yahoo.com/", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pete-buttigieg-bike-suv/", "https://partonews.ir/en/announcing-the-status-of-more-than-two-thousand-depot-vehicles-to-the-ministry-of-economy/", "https://www.isna.ir/news/1400080301446/%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%88%D8%B6%D8%B9%DB%8C%D8%AA-%DB%B2%DB%B2%DB%B4%DB%B9-%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%88-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%B3%D8%B1%DA%AF%D8%B1%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D9%84%D9%88%DA%A9%D8%B3-%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%AE%D8%A7%DA%A9", "https://www.reuters.com/article/iran-imports-chevrolet/iran-bans-import-of-chevrolet-cars-idUSL5N1804U8", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/2021-dodge-ram/"], "image_urls": ["https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/200/https:/media.snopes.com/2018/03/rating-false.png", "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2022/02/unsold-suvs-given-away-ad.jpg", "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2022/02/mysearches-unsold-suvs-page.jpg"]}

", "rating": "True", "article_text": "About this rating\n\nIn January 2022, BMW unveiled a concept car that could change its exterior color to various shades of grey. This car, the BMW iX Flow, is a concept car that is not available for purchase.\n\nIn 2014, we wrote about a viral video that supposedly showed the exterior of a car quickly changing colors . While this video racked up more than a million views, it showcased the work of a digital artist who was imagining a technology that didn't quite exist.\n\nWell, it appears that this color-changing car paint is now a reality. In January 2022, a video was widely circulated on social media that supposedly showed a car from German manufacturer BMW that could change the color of its exterior with a push of a button.\n\nAnother video from TikTok shows this car (The BMW iX Flow) changing colors from a different angle:\n\nThese videos show a concept car that was developed by BMW called the iX Flow. When the German manufacturer showcased this car during a virtual demonstration at CES 2022, they explained that the car was wrapped in E Ink Prism , a material developed in conjunction with E Ink (the company best known for developing displays for eReaders).\n\nCombining E Ink’s innovative and rugged digital paper with BMW’s intelligent design algorithms enables the exterior to change from black to white in a dynamic flow. The iX Flow is using E Ink Prism, a design film developed by E Ink for the architecture and design markets. E Ink Prism is fully programmable, giving BMW the creative freedom to customize the patterns and materials. To accomplish this, E Ink engineers worked closely with BMW engineers to create optimal functionality and perfect color switching of their complex laser cut designs which align with the curves of the car.\n\n\"E Ink's color changing technology is technically amazing. Seeing it formed on our highly curved surfaces is absolutely unexpected and seemingly magical,\" said Stella Clarke, Head of Project for the BMW iX Flow Featuring E Ink.\n\n[...]\n\n\"This concept car with BMW is an amazing display of how surfaces of the future will transform to personalize, customize and provide information,\" said Tim O'Malley, AVP, US Regional Business Unit. \"Because E Ink is incredibly low power and durable, we can put our display technology on almost any surface, transforming a once static space into something dynamic and spectacular – and sustainable.\"\n\nAt the moment, this color-changing vehicle can only display shades of grey. However, it's possible that more colors will be possible in the future. BMW said that this technology has many uses. For one, it gives drivers an opportunity to personalize their vehicles on the go. Second, the color of the car can be changed to make the vehicle more energy efficient (change to white to reflect heat on hot days and to black to absorb hear on cold ones).\n\nCar and Driver reports :\n\nAt the moment, the iX Flow can only shift through shades of white, grey, and black, but BMW suggested that adding vivid colors isn’t out of the realm of possibility. The E Ink wrap consists of millions of microcapsules containing negatively charged white pigments and positively charged black pigments. This microcapsules—which have a diameter equal to the thickness of a human hair—can be stimulated by an electrical field to bring different amounts of each pigment to the surface of the microcapsule, changing the shade of the car.\n\nHere's the official video from BMW of the color-changing iX Flow:\n\nThe official statement from BMW says that “on display [at CES] will be the first-ever demonstration of a technology that changes the exterior color of a vehicle with the touch of a button.” That’s all we’re being told for now but it definitely sounds incredibly interesting and sort-of illegal as well. At least in some countries, changing the color of your car is a tedious process that involves changing the info in your pinkslip and so on.\n\nWhile this tech might just be a showcase of what’s possible these days, the real-life applications might be limited at the end of the day. We also don’t have any clue as to how many colors we can browse through or what car will be used to showcase the tech, but we’ll find out all these details at the show.

{"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/only-two-cars-ohio-crashed-1895/", "title": "Does Photo Show an 1895 Car Crash Involving the Only 2 Cars in Ohio?", "author": "Dan Evon", "publish_date": "Nov. 1, 2021", "claim": "A photograph shows a car accident in 1895 involving the only two cars in Ohio. ", "rating": "Miscaptioned", "article_text": "About this rating\n\nThere is no documentation to support the claim that the only two cars in Ohio at the time crashed into one another in 1895. This rumor is almost certainly a modern day invention, and the photographs commonly attached to this claim are unrelated.\n\nOne common claim that is often circulated on social media holds that there was a car accident in 1895 that involved the only two cars in the entire state of Ohio.\n\nWe've been unable to find any documentation showing that such a crash occurred and the above-displayed photograph certainly wasn't taken in 1895.\n\nJohn Mohr, the Executive Director of the Society of Automotive Historians, told us that the cars in this picture were not available in 1895. Rather, these vehicles were likely manufactured decades later in the late 1920s or early 1930s.\n\nMohr, a native of Ohio, told us that he had heard this rumor a number of times but that he had never seen any documentation to prove that this crash took place as described. The crash was possible, according to Mohr, as there were some privately owned automobiles in Ohio at the time, but as the state didn't start keeping track of registrations until 1908 , it's impossible to tell how many cars were in operation in the state at the time.\n\nAs private automobiles were quite novel at the time, it's likely that a car crash in 1895 would've made headlines. We found numerous news articles about automobile crashes in the late 1890s and early 1900s, but we're able to find any reports about the only two cars in Ohio crashing into one another.\n\nWhile we've found no evidence to support this curious car crash claim, Ohio is home to a historically significant automobile accident. In 1891, the state saw what may have been the world's first car crash involving a gasoline powered vehicle. According to Ohio History Central, an Ohio history website run by the historical society Ohio History Connection, the first gas-powered automobile accident took place in 1891 and involved a single-cylinder gasoline automobile and a tree root.\n\nIn 1891, James William Lambert was involved in the first automobile accident in American history. The accident occurred in Ohio City, Ohio. Lambert's vehicle, the first single-cylinder gasoline automobile, which was carrying Lambert and James Swoveland, hit a tree root, causing the car to careen out of control and smash into a hitching post. Injuries from this accident were minor. Lambert proceeded to patent over six hundred inventions, mostly affiliated with the automobile industry.\n\nAn accident in Ireland preceded this crash by more than 20 years, but that crash involved a steam-powered vehicle. The Atlantic reported that an astronomer and naturalist named Mary Ward was the first person to be killed in an automobile accident when she was thrown from her cousin's vehicle and run over.\n\nIn August 1869, Mary Ward took a badly needed holiday at her cousin’s castle in the Irish midlands west of Dublin. Ward was an active naturalist and astronomer, working hard to carve out a place for herself in the overwhelmingly male world of Victorian science. She was also raising eight children more or less alone. She needed some rest, and when someone at the castle suggested taking her cousin’s homemade automobile out for a spin, Ward went along.\n\n[...]\n\nIn August 1869, when Ward visited her cousin’s castle, someone suggested taking the steam mobile out for a spin, and Ward agreed. There’s no record of who sat where, but four other people piled in as well. The party decided to circle the town green in Birr. According to one witness, the driver was “traveling at an easy pace” as he approached the turnaround point near Saint Brendan’s Church and rounded a corner.\n\nWhat happened next isn’t clear. Perhaps a wheel hit a rock or a pothole. Perhaps homemade cars in 1869 just didn’t run very smoothly. Regardless, the overcrowded carriage jolted during the turn, and Ward was bucked off. A second later, she hit the ground, and one of the huge iron wheels crushed her.\n\nThere's no evidence that the only two cars in the state of Ohio crashed into one another in 1895. So where does this story come from? The closest we could get to \"documentation\" of this event comes from an advertisement for Mobile gasoline that was published in Life Magazine in 1967 . That ad included a different photograph (one that we have not been able to find a source for) and a single sentence about this alleged 1895 car crash.\n\nThis is not historical documentation of a car crash. It's entirely possible that this anecdote was invented simply as a jumping off point for Mobil to make a somewhat confusing point about car accidents. (The Swedes did not lower car accidents by deciding that \"life is sweet\" and \"they want to live.\" The ad refers to Dagen H, the day Sweden switched from driving on the left-hand side of the road to the right. While this was viewed as a success at the time, car accidents returned to \"normal levels\" in the years since the switch.)\n\nThe claim that the only two cars in Ohio crashed into one another in 1895 is not supported by evidence. This anecdote appears to have originated with a 1967 advertisement and viral versions of this claim employ unrelated photographs of cars too modern for the time.\n\nSource:\n\nAssociates, d’Oliveira &. “The Fascinating History of Car Accidents.” Medium, 27 July 2016, https://medium.com/@YouMeanBusiness/the-fascinating-history-of-car-accidents-ac7478e0079e.\n\nFlock, Elizabeth. “Dagen H: The Day Sweden Switched Sides of the Road (Photo).” Washington Post, 17 Feb. 2012, https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/dagen-h-the-day-sweden-switched-sides-of-the-road-photo/2012/02/17/gIQAOwFVKR_blog.html.\n\nKean, Sam. “The First Fatal Car Crash.” The Atlantic, 29 Aug. 2019, https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/pioneering-female-scientist-was-first-car-crash-victim/597037/.\n\nLife Magazine.

", "rating": "False", "article_text": "About this rating\n\nOn May 19, 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden stopped by the Ford River Rouge Complex in Dearborn, Michigan, to tour the company's production facility for the new all-electric F-150 Lightning. At the end of the visit, Biden said that he was a \"car guy\" and that he would like to test drive the new vehicle. Ford obliged, and the president took a spin in the new electric vehicle, saying at the end of the ride that \"this sucker's quick.\"\n\nHere's a video of Biden's test drive from The Associated Press:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZE4_YXGBiI&t=50s\n\nWhile this moment was largely uneventful (although some took issue with a joke Biden made about hitting a reporter ), hyperpartisan news outlets and social media personalities claimed that this video actually documented a deepening conspiracy about Biden's health . The website Gateway Pundit published a slow-motion clip taken from C-SPAN's footage and claimed that it showed how Biden was \"faking\" this test drive, and that the truck was actually being controlled by the person in the passenger seat via a second steering wheel.\n\nThe Gateway Pundit wrote :\n\nWOW! Biden Caught Fake Driving — Someone Else Is Steering Vehicle — It Was All a Stunt! — VIDEO and PICS\n\n[...]\n\nFollowing his speech, the declining septuagenarian was put in an electric vehicle where he pretended to be driving. This was all a show by his handlers to make Joe Biden look like he’s in charge.\n\nBiden did not \"fake\" drive this truck, and this all-electric vehicle was not equipped with two steering wheels. Mike Levine, Ford North America product communications manager, confirmed to the automative news website Jalopnik that “there was no other set of controls\" in the vehicle Biden drove.\n\nThe object the Gateway Pundit claims the passenger is holding in this video is not a steering wheel. It's a camera. It appears that the secret service agent was simply reaching out to make sure that this camera didn't fall off the dashboard. Here's an enlarged image showing this moment. The Gateway Pundit's main piece of \"evidence\" for the double-driver conspiracy theory is superimposed in the top left:\n\nFurthermore, other images exist showing other angles of the drive that make it clear this vehicle didn't have two steering wheels. At the end of the above-displayed video from The Associated Press, for instance, you can get a glimpse through the windshield that shows Biden's hands on the steering wheel and no steering wheel visible on the passenger side. At another moment, we get a view through the passenger side windows which, again, shows Biden with his hands on the wheel and the passenger without a steering wheel.\n\nThis moment is more clearly visible in the original video from from C-SPAN.\n\nhttps://www.c-span.org/video/?511860-101/president-biden-test-drives-ford-electric-vehicle\n\nThe claim that Biden \"fake\" drove this vehicle can also be disproven by the fact that this drive wasn't entirely scheduled. If you noticed in these videos, there is some odd material hanging on the side of this all-electric F-150 Lightning. This is not part of the design of the vehicle that will be available for purchase. This is a sort of camouflage that the company uses to obscure the public's view of vehicles before they are officially released.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press reported that Ford had to scramble a little after Biden asked to test drive one of their vehicles.\n\nPresident Biden, 78, whose father sold Fords back in the day, wrapped up his remarks on Tuesday at the new plant in the Rouge complex designed to build the all-electric F-150 Lightning and it all seemed routine to those present.\n\nUntil it wasn't.\n\n\"At the end of his speech, he kinda turned to everyone, he goes, 'You know I'm a car guy. And I want to drive this truck.' Everyone politely laughed. Because presidents don't drive vehicles,'\" Ford CEO Jim Farley told the Free Press ...\n\nAnd then it happened.\n\n\"Lo and behold, I get a tap on my shoulder (apparently from White House staff) at the very end of the event,\" Farley said. \"They said, 'Mr. Farley, we'd like you to come with us to the motorcade because we want to go to the test track and drive the truck.\"\n\nSo Farley and chief engineer Linda Zhang went together to a Ford test track nearby.\n\n\"All the media was there. And the whole presidential motorcade,\" Farley said. \"We’ve never had the presidential motorcade at our test track before. I think all our team members were kind of stunned to see the president of the United States come to the test track.

One photograph supposedly showed a car trunk loaded with plastic bags filled with gasoline:\n\nA video supposedly showed a woman filling up plastic bags at a gasoline pump:\n\nBoth of these pieces of media are real, but neither relates to the May 2021 gas shortage in the southeastern United States. Both of these images are several years old, and one was taken outside of the United States.\n\nThe picture of plastic bags filled with gasoline in the trunk of a car comes from a March 2019 incident in which two men attempted to steal gasoline from a gas station in Huauchinango, a city located north of the state of Puebla in central Mexico.\n\nNoticieros.televisa.com reported at the time (translated via Google):\n\n\"Elements of the Federal Police Gendarmerie Division, in coordination with personnel from the Secretary of the Navy, detained the drivers of two vehicles that were transporting more than a thousand liters of gasoline in plastic bags, in the municipality of Huauchinango, Puebla.\"\n\nThe video of the woman filling up a plastic bag at a gasoline pump is also several years old. This video first went viral in December 2019, and supposedly shows a woman at a gas station in Houston, Texas.\n\nThe video prompted the automotive website The Drive to publish an article informing people that they should never use plastic bags to transport gasoline:\n\nJason Rudison spotted this woman fueling up at the Kroger gas pumps in Houston, Texas, pouring gas into a plastic bag ...\n\nOne catch: Gasoline is heavy! Naturally, this led to a blowout of the woman's first bag, spilling fuel all around the pump. That's when she double-bagged the first bag anyway and put it in her Honda Accord's trunk.\n\nAccording to Rudison's wife Aisha on Facebook, the woman in the video was warned several times by a couple of other people around her not to fill the plastic bags with gas before Rudison started filling. So, I can't blame Jason for staying far away from this one. She should've gotten the hint from those warnings, and sometimes you just have to accept that you personally can't fix stupid.\n\nWhile neither of these pieces of media were taken in May 2021, some people truly were \"panic buying\" gasoline amidst reports of shortages.\n\nCBS affiliate Kiro 7 News reported :\n\nDrivers from the East Coast through the Deep South, fearful that a cyberattack on a 5,500-mile long pipeline might leave them stranded, scrambled to fill up their cars Tuesday, leaving some stations across the region short on supplies of gasoline.\n\nThe cyberattack Friday on the Colonial Pipeline led to the surge in demand that saw cars lined up at gas stations and prices jump anywhere from 2 to 10 cents in a day.\n\nThe East Coast reported a 32.5% increase in demand Monday compared to the previous week, with the Gulf Coast at a 13.1% increase. As of Tuesday night, that demand had left nearly 1,800 stations in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Maryland and Virginia without gasoline.\n\nReports about people filling up plastic bags with gasoline prompted the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (USCPSC) to offer some blunt advice on social media:\n\nThe USCPSC went on to urge people only to use containers that have been specifically approved to carry fuel:", "article_links": ["https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rating/miscaptioned", "https://www.snopes.com/ap/2021/05/08/major-us-pipeline-halts-operations-after-ransomware-attack/", "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/colonial-pipeline-shutdown-panic-buying-gas-hoarding-long-lines-outages/", "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/05/gas-shortage-posts.jpg", "https://noticieros.televisa.com/ultimas-noticias/detienen-dos-robar-gasolina-transportarla-bolsas-plastico-puebla/", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRjNdgAetQE&t=1s", "https://www.thedrive.com/news/31567/psa-you-should-never-ever-try-to-carry-gasoline-in-a-plastic-bag", "https://www.kiro7.com/news/trending/colonial-pipeline-cyberattack-panic-buying-causing-shortages-how-find-stations-with-gasoline/6VE5S7RXLREXNKW2XCGBH3U7AM/", "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-12-091916.jpg"], "image_urls": ["https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/200/https:/media.snopes.com/2018/03/rating-miscaptioned.png", "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/05/gas-shortage-posts.jpg", "https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2021/05/Screenshot-2021-05-12-091916.jpg"]}

{"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/full-gas-tank-explosion/", "title": "Will Cars with Full Gas Tanks Explode on Hot Days?", "author": "Alex Kasprak", "publish_date": "July 2, 2018", "claim": "On hot summer days, you should avoid filling your car’s gas tank completely due to a risk of explosion.", "rating": "False", "article_text": "About this rating\n\nSince at least as far back as 2011, the Internet has been plagued by a viral warning about a danger to car owners, who supposedly create a significant risk of explosion by filling their vehicles' gas tanks to capacity during hot weather:\n\nThis premise sounds terrifying, but thankfully it makes zero scientific sense.\n\nThis claim is complete hogwash for two clear and incontrovertible reasons. The first is that the temperature at which fuel auto-ignites (i.e. the temperature at which fuel will combust without a trigger or spark) is around 495ºF . This level is far higher than any temperature a covered, insulated tank could possibly achieve simply by being driven or parked on planet Earth.\n\nThe second reason concerns the implication that pressure will dangerously build up in car's gas tank during hot weather, leading to higher temperatures within the tank and, somehow, an eventual spontaneous explosion. However, modern fuel tanks must have the ability to vent pressure.\n\nSince 1971 , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required that all internal combustion engine cars include evaporative emission control (or EVAP ) systems. This mechanism collects excess fuel vented from a tank (to maintain even pressure) and, when conditions are correct, returns it to the tank.\n\nPrior to the adoption of these regulations, many gas tanks simply relied upon vented gas caps , leading to the occasional release of liquid gas onto the ground or the emission of volatile chemicals into the atmosphere. A significant build-up of pressure would still not occur in such older vehicles, however.\n\nWhen this rumor hit the Middle East in 2015, the local press were quick to debunk it:\n\nThe new rumour last week was about the dangers of filling car tanks to the maximum capacity in summer months circulated widely on social media. As usual the rumour-monger[ing] attributed the information to an official body — Adnoc Distribution.\n\nThe rumour mill on social media suggested that fully filled car tanks could cause fires or explosions in summer.\n\nAdnoc Distribution confirmed that it has not issued any warnings against filling car tanks to maximum capacity.\n\nKhalid Hadi, Vice-President, Marketing and Corporate Communications at Adnoc Distribution, said: “We would like to point out that filling fuel tanks to full capacity does not imply any risks as all car fuel tanks are designed to withstand pressure build-up in high temperatures.”\n\n“Furthermore, Adnoc Distribution has not registered any such previous incident [of cars exploding]. The rumour attributed to us is based on unknown sources, and is therefore completely false,” Hadi said.\n\nThe 2018 version of this rumor (reproduced in a graphic at the head of this page) attributes the warning to Pakistan State Oil (PSO), who similarly took to social media to disclaim it:\n\n<!--\n\nPakistan State Oil (PSO) has announced that filling fuel tank to its full capacity poses no threat of any kind to the cars or its passengers. PSO made the statement after a Whatsapp message went viral over the past few days.

While not everything claimed in the item is true, its central claim about driving in the rain while wearing sunglasses is.\n\nWearing polarized sunglasses when driving in the rain during the day will help a driver see better. Polarized sunglasses work to block horizontal components of scattered or reflected light, which means they help counteract the scattering of light that atmospheric effects like fog or rain have on daylight.\n\nNotice, however, that this ability is limited to polarized sunglasses. Non-polarized lenses won't do anything other than make the field of vision darker, which means wearing them while driving in the rain would increase the hazard, not reduce it.\n\nExamples:\n\nGOOD VISION IN A DOWNPOUR\n\nHow to achieve good vision while driving during a heavy downpour.

It works to eliminate the \"blindness\" from passing cars. Or the \"kickup\" if you are following a car in the rain.\n\nThey ought to teach this little tip in driver's training.. It really does work. This is a good warning. I wonder how many people knew about this???\n\nIn July 2010, a version began circulating that combined the \"sunglasses in the rain\" piece with the admonition against engaging cruise control on wet roads.\n\nOne caveat though: Wearing polarized lenses while driving may make LCD dashboard displays quite a bit harder to read.\n\nIn a nutshell:\n\nWear polarized sunglasses when driving in rain during the day. First and foremost, forget about driving in an absolute downpour — instead, get off the road and wait out the storm. However, during light to moderate rainfalls, polarized sunglasses will help the driver see more clearly.\n\nLenses must be polarized. Despite the e-mail's assertion that \"any model will do,\" non-polarized sunglasses will not improve clarity of vision in the rain. Indeed, they will make matters worse.\n\nWear polarized sunglasses when driving in fog during the day. Get off the road and stay off the road when fog is heavy; but in light to moderate fogs and mists, polarized sunglasses will assist drivers in the same fashion that they do in light to moderate rains.\n\nDon't wear sunglasses while driving at night. Although polarized sunglasses will help improve clarity of vision during the day in rain or fog, at night they will serve to reduce contrast and thus make a mess of the driver's depth perception.

Automobiles are large and complex, and as any car owner quickly discovers, malfunction of even the smallest and most seemingly unimportant automotive part can be all that it takes to render them inoperative.\n\nTidbits of whispered wisdom therefore prove popular among the less than automotively inclined, who look to keep their vehicles running even if they're not quite sure exactly how to go about that.\n\nOne bit of whispered wisdom dictates that a car's battery must never be stored on a concrete or cement floor. The reasons given for this prohibition vary depending on whom one hears the admonition from. Acid leaking from the battery will ruin the floor, say some. Or a battery left sitting on such surface will never again properly hold a charge. Or those particular surfaces will cause a battery to lose some of its charge. Look at this email we received in May 2002, for example:\n\nRecently, I needed some work done on my car. My brother, who is a fair mechanic, offered to help me (I am pushed to my limit just changing a headlight). When we removed the battery from the car, I set it on the floor of the garage. My brother told me to pick up the battery and place it on a couple of 2-by-4s because \"putting it on the floor will ruin it\".\n\nApparently, he is under the impression that putting a car battery on a concrete floor would drain it! Not only that, but that the battery would not \"take a charge\" after this occurred.\n\nOddly, the reality behind this peculiar automotive belief somewhat mirrors the long-standing urban legend about a mysterious and seemingly nonsensical cooking practice handed down through three generations: just as there was once something to Grandma's oddball cooking secret , so too was there a time when storing car batteries on concrete or cement floors was a lousy thing to do. However (and again just like the \"cooking secret\" legend), whereas at one time there was good reason for the practice, those days have long since passed.\n\nCar batteries used to be encased in hard rubber, a substance that was porous enough that battery acid could seep through it and create a conductive path through the damp concrete, draining the battery. The cases of today’s batteries, however, are made of sturdier stuff that far better contains their contents than those of yesteryear. As well, time has brought technological improvements to the seals around the posts and the vent systems.\n\nThese days, the problem of car battery electrolyte seepage and migration has been all but eliminated. Says battery manufacturer Yuasa , \"Nowadays, containers are made from a solid plastic that does not allow any current to flow through it, so the batteries do not discharge, even if they sit in a few inches of water.\"\n\nInterestingly, some experts (including Car Talk's Click and Clack) believe that storing car batteries on concrete floors might actually be a better idea than keeping them on shelves or other surfaces because the cold of the floor works to slow the self-discharge (leakage) rate.\n\nYou can learn more about how car batteries work here .", "article_links": ["https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rating/false", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/grandmas-cooking-secret/", "https://www.yuasabatteries.com/resources/faqs/\"", "https://www.batteryfaq.org/\""], "image_urls": ["https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/200/https:/media.snopes.com/2018/03/rating-false.png"]}

One would think I would have noticed the little secret on my dash that was staring me right in the face the whole time. I didn't and I bet you probably haven't either.\n\nQuick question, what side of your car is your gas tank? You probably can't remember right away especially if you drive more than one car or if you do a rental while on vacation.\n\nMy solution was to uncomfortably stick my head out the window, strain my neck and look. If you don't do this in your own car you definitely have done it in a borrowed or rental car.\n\nIf you look at your gas gauge, you will see a small icon of a gas pump. The handle of the gas pump will extend out on either the left or right side of the pump.\n\nIf your tank is on the left, the handle will be on the left. If your tank is on the right, the handle will be on the right (see attached images).\n\nIt is that simple!\n\nWhy don't the dealers share such important information with car buyers? I have on purpose asked many car salesmen since I found this out and 'THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS - NOT ONE DID'.\n\nAs anyone who has driven a rental car well knows, it is indeed useful to have some sort of indicator on the instrument panel that reveals which side to refuel on. Sadly, \"The World's Best Kept Auto Secret\" (as the e-mail was often titled) was a bit of misinformation or a misunderstanding: while the indicator it described was real, the \"The World's Best Kept Auto Secret\" message misidentified its nature.\n\nThe nozzle-and-hose side of the fuel level (or \"low fuel\") indicator, which is usually presented as an icon depicting a gas pump, doesn't consistently correspond with the side of the car where the fuel door is to be found, nor does its placement on the instrument array (left side versus right side) tell whether you should bring the passenger's or driver's side up next to the pumps at your local gas station.\n\nThere's no magic to it. Although \"The World's Best Kept Auto Secret\" will prove true for some vehicles, it won't for others, it's akin to the many folkloric \"tests\" for determining an unborn child's sex , it has only two outcomes (the icon's nozzle-and-hose side and the side the vehicle's fuel door is on match or they don't), so this \"secret\" will work sometimes but not always. (Yes, we know that some vehicles have their fuel doors in the back, but there are so few of them that for the purpose of this discussion we might as well ignore that possibility.)\n\nThe fuel icons in modern cars do inform drivers which side to refuel on, but it's not the placement or shape of the fuel icon that carries that information: Nearly all newer models of automobiles include a small arrow or triangle next to the fuel icon that indicates which side of the vehicle bears the fuel door. As seen in the graphic example displayed below, sometimes the arrow and fuel handle are on opposite sides of the icon; it's the former, not the latter, that signifies where the gas cap is:\n\nThere's no agreement among auto manufacturers as to which side the gas cap should be on (which, if they would just choose one side or the other, would solve the whole problem right there: you'd then always know which side of your vehicle to park closest to the pump). It would make more sense to consistently position the aperture on the passenger's side, both because it's easier to get out of your vehicle when you don't have to weasel your bulk past the gas pump you've just parked next to, and because should you run out of gas on the highway, it's a lot safer to pour more in when you're not standing next to the traffic whizzing by you.\n\nAn argument can also be made for placing the gas cap on the rear of vehicles. Were it there, you would no longer need be concerned about getting any particular side of your car sidled up to the pump: provided the rear of the vehicle were somewhat close to the refueling array, it wouldn't matter if the gas pump island were to the left or the right.\n\nYet another solution would be to have two fuel entry doors, one on each side. That notion, however, fails on cost. According to Rick Asher, a spokesman for General Motors, the cost of putting a gas cap on both sides of a vehicle would far exceed the value of the added convenience for the vast majority of people.\n\nWhich leaves us right back where we started, which is having to make mental note of which side a vehicle's fuel door is on when driving rentals or other cars unfamiliar to us (or try checking the side-view mirrors to see where it is before pulling up to the pumps).", "article_links": ["https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rating/mixture", "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/drano-test/"], "image_urls": ["https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/200/https:/media.snopes.com/2018/03/rating-mixture.png", "https://www.snopes.com/uploads/2014/10/fuelicon.jpg"]}

Upon occasion, however, a discontinued product has retained a strong enough following among a devoted group of aficionados for another company to venture licensing or purchasing the rights from the original manufacturer and resuming production. (One example of this phenomenon occurred when INTV bought the rights to the Intellivision video game system from Mattel, selling off old inventory and then producing new consoles and game cartridges.)\n\nThat's the basic idea behind a tale from the original (1975) edition of The People's Almanac , about a group of disenchanted General Motors stylists who left the company and spent ten years between 1958 and 1967 cranking out a few hundred thousand copies of the discontinued 1957 model Chevrolet at a small, private plant in Illinois — but the kicker is that they supposedly did all this without the knowledge, cooperation, or consent of General Motors:\n\nThe 1957 Chevrolet was introduced by General Motors in late 1956, as part of their special Labor Day Sneak Preview of New Cars. The '57 Chevy sported nonfunctional tail fins and excess side trim like most American cars of that era, and it would have passed into obscurity except for the amazing popularity of the design in the years that followed. While the Chevy's competitors disappeared into the junkyards of the nation, the '57 throve, particularly the 2-door Bel-Air model. The car became a favorite of customizers in Southern California, and its popularity spread across the nation. The '57 Chevy has been almost as visible on the highways of America as the Volkswagen, particularly in California and the Midwest.\n\nIn 1965, the California Department of Motor Vehicles listed 35,000 '57 Chevies on the road — an astounding survival rate for an American car (although in 1957, Chevrolet enjoyed total sales of 775,000 units). No other American automobile has survived the years with equal fortitude.\n\nHowever, no other American automobile, with the exception of the limited-production Studebaker Avanti, has enjoyed the unique production facilities of the '57 Chevy. There have been subsequent designs for subsequent Chevrolet model years, but the '57, unlike any other American car and contrary to American industrial practice, enjoyed a manufacturer's run of 10 years.\n\nA dedicated group of ex-Chevrolet stylists and franchised used-car salesmen continued to turn out close to 200,000 1957 Chevrolets, focusing on the 2-door Bel-Air model, between the years 1957 and 1967, in a small auto assembly plant located outside Jacksonville, Ill.\n\nThe enthusiasts, led by ex-General Motors stylist Ardell Malowick, quit GM in mid-1957 when it was learned, to nobody's surprise, that the 1957 design was to be scrapped in favor of the longer, lower, wider '58 Chevy, which replaced the '57's peaked fins with contoured, sublimated fins.\n\nMalowick and his associates quickly decamped and purchased their own auto assembly facilities in southern Illinois. However, Malowick was unable to finance the die molds and giant steel presses which GM and Fisher Auto Body used to construct the basic body; rather, Malowick relied on the proved European coach-building technique of pounding body shape out by hand over wooden molds, formed from fiber-glass replicas of the real thing. In this way, some of the imperfections of Fisher's mass production were eliminated.\n\nMalowick and associates knew that Chevrolet, which held all legal rights to the design, would not consent to the manufacture of '57 Chevies to compete with their '58s and subsequent models. Perhaps GM was aware, as Malowick now contends, that subsequent models could never compete with the '57 for purity of design. Because of legal restrictions, the post-1957 new '57 Chevies built by Malowick were sold as remarkably well-preserved used cars in car lots across the U.S.\n\nIn the sale of these cars, Malowick enjoyed the clandestine cooperation of countless used-car merchants throughout the nation who were in sympathy with his cause. Certainly, used car dealers sought Malowick's creations with a fervor they have not displayed for any other American vehicle before or since.\n\nMalowick was able to survive financially by his relatively high wholesale price, and a low overhead provided in part by engines and chassis pirated from Chrysler warehouses in northern Illinois (accounting partially for Chrysler's bewildering stock nose dive during and immediately after their \"forward look\" phase), and from sales to special collectors and customizers, mostly in California, who were willing to pay anything for a '57 Chevy in good condition.\n\nBy far Malowick's most successful model was, of course, the 2-door Bel Air with the metallic plum paint, many which can be seen on the streets of most American cities today.\n\nIn 1967, Malowick was forced to close down shop because of rising costs and the rumors that General Motors was wise to his operations and was preparing legal action.\n\nMalowick has since gone into the business of manufacturing denim boots and book bags, but he is considering another automobile operation if he can locate favorable conditions, possibly in Germany. There is a rumor that the giant Volkswagen Corporation, which has thought about opening a factory in the U.S., has made overtures to Malowick regarding the 1973 Buick Riviera, another classic of American design.\n\nThe story seems a fairly obvious bit of humor chock full of tongue-in-cheek jabs at the auto industry (especially evident in the closing reference to Volkswagen's supposed interest in opening a U.S. plant to produce 1973 Buick Rivieras — this was written in 1975, shortly after the Riviera had also undergone a significant and much-criticized design change), but its inclusion in a reference work with no external indicator of its fictional status has led many readers in the years since to take it seriously. For those who prefer a more thorough debunking, we highlight a few of the tale's many implausibilities below:\n\nWe have found no mention whatsoever of \"Ardell Malowick\" or his scheme of producing '57 Chevies in any source outside of The People's Almanac ; not a single book, newspaper, or magazine article about either subject (save for those that simply reference the original People's Almanac story).\n\nWe've contacted a number of vintage car clubs, including ones that specialize in Chevrolet automobiles from the 1950s, and have yet to find a single person who has owned or seen (even in photographs) one of the faux '57 Chevies, anyone who worked in a dealership that sold them, any mechanic who ever serviced one of them, or anybody employed by the plant that supposedly produced them.\n\nThe phony Chevy plant in Illinois reportedly turned out 200,000 automobiles in a ten-year period — that's 400 cars a week, every week, for ten years! Where did a small group of former GM workers raise the capital to start up and run such a massive (and illicit) manufacturing venture, all within the space of a few months? How did the plant's owners/operators, all their employees, and all the auto dealerships engaged in selling the faux '57 Chevies account for the expenses, revenues, income, and taxes associated with a product they couldn't legally make or offer for sale? How did dealers manage to sell, without anyone's noticing, a few hundred thousand cars for which they could establish no valid history or chain of ownership, and which could not be traced by VINs or other identifiers to a legitimate manufacturer?\n\nWe don't know how this tale ended up being published in The People's Almanac : whether the compilers decided to include bit of drollery in the book as lark, or a prankish writer managed to slip a gag past unsuspecting editors, or a gullible researcher was taken in by a tall tale. But the story is indeed a joke, and, judging by the results, a good one at that.\n\nIn honor of the 50th anniversary of the classic automobile's introduction, CARS Inc. announced in 2006 that they would begin offering newly-[re]built (from original cowls) 1957 Chevrolet convertibles.", "article_links": ["https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rating/false", "https://www.intellivisionlives.com/\"", "https://www.57classicchevy.com/\"", "https://www.musclecarclub.com/musclecars/buick-riviera/buick-riviera-history.shtml\"", "https://www.1957chevybody.com/\""], "image_urls": ["https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/200/https:/media.snopes.com/2018/03/rating-false.png"]}

I hydroplaned on Hwy 135 between Gladewater & Kilgore, Texas. I was not hurt, just emotionally rattled! I know the Lord was with me.\n\nI learned a lesson I'd like to pass on to you. You may know this already — but the highway patrolman told me that you should NEVER drive in the rain with your cruise control on. He said if you did and hydroplaned (which I did) that when your tires were off the road your car would accelerate to a high rate of speed (which it did). You don't have much, if any control when you hydroplane, but you are totally in the hands of God when the car accelerates. I took off like I was in an airplane. I'm so thankful I made it through that ordeal. Please pass the word around about not using cruise control when the pavement is wet or icy. The highway patrolman said this should be on the sun-visor with the warning about air-bags.\n\nThe only person I've found out who knew this (besides the patrolman) was a man who had a similar accident and totaled his car. This has made me wonder if this is not why so many of our young people are dying in accidents.\n\nBe careful out there!\n\nSome good advice, and you may know this already, but it is good to repeat!\n\nA 36 year old female had an accident several weeks ago and totaled her car. A resident of Kilgore, Texas, she was traveling between Gladewater & Kilgore. It was raining, though not excessive, when her car suddenly began to hydroplane and literally flew through the air.\n\nShe was not seriously injured but very stunned at the sudden occurrence!\n\nWhen she explained to the highway patrolman what had happened he told her something that every driver should know NEVER DRIVE IN THE RAIN WITH YOUR CRUISE CONTROL ON. She had thought she was being cautious by setting the cruise control and maintaining a safe consistent speed in the rain. But the highway patrolman told her that if the cruise control is on and your car begins to hydroplaned - when your tires loose contact with the pavement your car will accelerate to a higher rate of speed and you take off like an airplane.. She told the patrolman that was exactly what had occurred.\n\nWe all know you have little or no control over a car when it begins to hydroplane. You are at the mercy of the Good Lord. The highway patrol estimated her car was actually traveling through the air at 10 to 15 miles per hour faster than the speed set on the cruise control.\n\nThe patrolman said this warning should be listed, on the drivers seat sun-visor - NEVER USE THE CRUISE CONTROL WHEN THE PAVEMENT IS WET OR ICY along with the airbag warning.\n\nWe tell our teenagers to set the cruise control and drive a safe speed but we don't tell them to use the cruise control only when the pavement is dry. The only person the accident victim found, who knew this (besides the patrolman), was a man who had had a similar accident, totaled his car and sustained severe injuries.\n\nIf you send this to 15 people and only one of them doesn't know about this, then it was all worth it. You might have saved a life.\n\nAlthough these accounts are probably \"real\" in the sense that they indeed reflect someone's attempt to describe an automotive mishap that actually happened to him, the explanation about a hydroplaning car's suddenly accelerating and \"taking off like a rocket\" due to the use of cruise control is a garbled one probably reflecting the author's misunderstanding of what had occurred.\n\nNonetheless, the warning inherent to the tale — don't engage your vehicle's cruise control on slippery or wet roads — is well worth heeding. Snow, ice, slush, or even rain can cause wheel-spin and loss of control, situations to which drivers must react quickly. Although cruise control can generally be cut off by the driver's simply tapping the brake pedal, the extra reaction time required for a motorist relying upon cruise control to recognize the danger of the situation when his wheels begins to spin or slide on a slippery surface, bring his foot up off the floor to the brake pedal, and disengage the cruise control can be crucial (especially for drivers lured into a hazardous level of inattentiveness on long, flat stretches of road).\n\nAccording to the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia's web page of tips about driving on wet roads:\n\nThe only way to stop wheels from spinning and maintain control is to immediately reduce power. An activated cruise control system applies continuous power, keeping the wheels spinning. By the time you disengage the cruise control it may be too late – you may have already lost control.\n\nAn example from the weekly \"Drive It Forever'' automotive column by New York Times Syndicate writer Bob Sikorsky provided a description of one such occurrence:\n\nDear Bob: Cruise control can be dangerous. I have experienced, when driving in heavy rain or slush conditions with the cruise control set at a speed of around 70 mph, that one front wheel will hydroplane while the other wheel suddenly gets traction. Result: The car spins out and into the ditch or into traffic.\n\nI have been lucky to be able to catch it happening and touch the brake and recover quickly. As a former pilot, I literally wear the car and feel its moves and respond accordingly.\n\nUse of the cruise control in these conditions can be dangerous.\n\nEnjoy your column every week — keep up the good work.\n\nSincerely, B.D., Albany, N.Y.\n\nA: While I haven't heard of this particular problem with cruise control, I can see your point — and indeed the experience you describe sounds like a hazardous one. The safety implications for an average driver are considerable.\n\nI agree, in short: In heavy rain or slush, the cruise should not be set at a high speed.\n\nFor that matter, though, even without the cruise engaged, high speed under the aforesaid conditions is dangerous in and of itself. You really shouldn't be driving at 70 mph in slippery conditions, cruise or no cruise. Nor should any driver.\n\nWet-road driving is fraught with dangers that are not always immediately apparent. Just a thin layer of water lying on pavement can send an unsuspecting car hydroplaning into another lane — the car's wheels skim along the water's surface instead of making contact with the road. Also, roads constantly accumulate oily substances loosed by car exhaust, and this residue settles deep into the pavement. Rain brings this oil back to the surface, making roads especially slippery during that first hour of downpour or misting.\n\nLikewise, winter driving carries with it a similar set of perils. Ice, snow, and sleet can make for dangerously slippery conditions, but so too can innocuous-looking slush and all-but-invisible \"black ice.\" Those who habitually rely upon their vehicles' cruise controls should eschew the practice during the winter months, because the moments it takes to disengage cruise may be moments you don't have during a spin-out.", "article_links": ["https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/rating/mixture", "https://www.icbc.com/news/nov20-08\""], "image_urls": ["https://mediaproxy.snopes.com/width/200/https:/media.snopes.com/2018/03/rating-mixture.png"]}

Days later, the woman was cruising along a highway in the Washington, D.C., area, when her baby started crying from the back of the van. The dutiful mother momentarily left the wheel to get the baby, and a multiple-car crash (with only minor injuries) ensued. Allstate paid off that claim.\n\n[Collected on the Internet, 1995]\n\nThis guy saves up his money and finally gets the van he always wanted. Fridge and tv in the back, all the works. He starts driving out on a country road that leads to his home. He sets the van on cruise control and gets out of the drivers seat and goes into the back to get a beer. The van of course goes off the road, and when the paramedics ask him what happened, he said he thought he had auto-pilot.\n\n[Collected on the Internet, 1993]\n\nAn old china man was driving along in his motor home. He turned on his 'cruise control'. Apparently misunderstanding the function of 'cruise control', he then went into the back of the motor home. The motor home drove off the road and crashed.\n\nApparently he did not realize that 'cruise control' is not 'autopilot.'\n\nJan Harold Brunvand, the master of urban legends, has a fair bit to say about this legend.\n\nThe legend began in the late 1970s when cruise control was first available for RVs (which then was the vehicle always featured in this legend). As he says, \"Sometimes it was a retired couple that made the dangerous (but never fatal) error with cruise control, otherwise it was a young and naive driver.\"\n\nVersions starring a wealthy student from the Middle East also began circulating at that time (one reader recalls seeing such a tale mentioned in a newspaper in 1977 or 1978), but these don't appear to have achieved widespread acceptance until 1984 or thereabouts. Wrote Brunvand: \"The implication here, of course, is that rich Arabs don't understand technology, and as a result they may be 'getting what they deserve' when they spend their wealth so lavishly in the United States.\"\n\nThese days, the victim(s) will often be described as an older couple, people you'd find it likely to believe would be baffled by the technology. In earlier versions from around the time of the Great Gasoline Shortage in the U.S., you'd be told the victim was an Arab with too much money and too little sense. In versions earlier than that, the victims were unfamiliar with the technology not because they were new to this country or plain mechanical klutzs, but rather because the technology itself was new.\n\nBrunvand also points out: \"A persistent feature in car legends of this kind is the denigration of a minority person (senior citizen, foreigner, woman, etc.) who allegedly misunderstands the nature of some new but fairly uncomplicated technological device.\"\n\nIn the spring of 2002, a telling of the venerable Cruise Control legend became part of a widely circulated \"outrageous lawsuits\" list known on the Internet as the \" Stella Awards \":\n\nIn November 2000, Mr. Grazinski purchased a brand new 32 foot Winnebago motor home. On his first trip home, having joined the freeway, he set the cruise control at 70 mph and calmly left the drivers seat to go into the back and make himself a cup of coffee. Not surprisingly, the Winnie left the freeway, crashed and overturned. Mr. Grazinski sued Winnebago for not advising him in the handbook that he could not actually do this. He was awarded $1,750,000 plus a new Winnebago.\n\nIn September 2009, the Grazinski entry reappeared, this time changing the hapless driver into a woman:\n\nThis year's runaway First Place Stella Award winner was: Mrs. Merv Grazinski, of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, who purchased new 32-foot Winnebago motor home. On her first trip home, from an OU football game, having driven on to the freeway, she set the cruise control at 70 mph and calmly left the driver's seat to go to the back of the Winnebago to make herself a sandwich. Not surprisingly, the motor home left the freeway, crashed and overturned.

", "rating": "Legend", "article_text": "About this rating\n\nExamples:\n\n[Weekly World News, 1988]\n\nA 32-year-old roofer was jerked to the ground and dragged almost 200 feet when his wife drove away in the family car with his safety rope tied to the bumper!\n\nDavid Willis was hospitalized with a broken leg, cracked ribs, concussion and numerous bumps and bruises after the bizarre accident.\n\nBut he told reporters in Cape Town, South Africa, that he's lucky to be around to talk about his close call.\n\n\"One second I was hammering the roof and the next I was plowing up tomato plants in the garden,\" he continued.\n\n\"Everything happened so fast it was like a dream. But I was in so much pain I knew that what was happening was real.\"\n\nWillis said the drama unfolded a few minutes after he climbed onto the roof of his house to replace some weather-beaten shingles.\n\nHe tied one end of a safety rope to the chimney and pulled the loose end through the belt loop in his pants. He then dropped the rope down to his 9-year-old son and told him to attach it \"to something secure.\"\n\nThe dutiful child promptly tied the rope to the bumper of his mother's car and scampered off to a nearby park to play.\n\n\"My wife and I spoke to each other as she got into the car to go shopping,\" said Willis.\n\n\"But neither of us noticed that the rope was tied to the bumper.\"\n\n\"I turned around and started hammering on a shingle just as she pulled away. I hit the ground hard and shot right through the garden fence.\"\n\n\"I figured I was dragged about 200 feet through the grass before the rope finally broke.\"\n\nWillis' wife Michelle didn't realize what happened and drove off into the distance.\n\nA neighbor found Willis writhing in his front yard and called an ambulance.\n\n\"I'm in no condition to spank my son even if I wanted to,\" said Willis.\n\n\"Actually, I don't think I need to. He knows his thoughtlessness almost killed daddy.\"\n\n[Smith, 1986]\n\nAlthough he was rather afraid of heights, an aspirant DIY [do it yourself] man decided to repair his house chimney. Tying a rope to the ladder, he threw the other end over the roof and anchored it to the rear bumper of his car.\n\nHe was half-way up the ladder when his wife came out and got into the car to go shopping. \"I wondered what the scream was as I drove away,\" she told the coroner at the inquest into her husband's death.\n\nOrigins: Weekly World News article or not, no one should be overly tempted to mistake the first example for an actual event. The \"man on the roof\" tale has been a popular urban legend since at least the mid-1960s.\n\nWhat inspires the intrepid home improver to ascend to those dizzying heights varies from telling to telling: he's there to adjust a malfunctioning TV antenna,\n\nto push down a heavy accumulation of snow, to fix a chimney, or to hammer down loose shingles. Sometimes the plan is to hoist him halfway up the side of the house (to fix a window or slap some paint on) by having a friend slowly back the car away, but even this always goes wrong. One non-roof version features a mechanic repairing the wing of a large aircraft while secured by rope to a portable piece of large ground equipment which, of course, gets ported away while he's tied to it.\n\nThe brave soul flung through the air is always a man, and most of the time the one who thoughtlessly drives off without noticing a rope tied to the car's bumper is his wife. When what she's off to do is described, it's invariably a typically female pursuit — she's going shopping or heading to the beauty parlor.\n\nThe stereotypes of the foolhardy yet enthusiastic weekend handyman and the shopping and beauty-obsessed woman are obvious. Shortcomings of both contribute to the accident.\n\nSightings: In an episode of the TV show Emergency! (\"The Game,\" original air date 25 September 1976), a man on a roof tosses his safety rope to his son, who ties it to the bumper of Mom's car. Mom and daughter come out of the house, get into the car, and drive off, in the process flinging the man into a tree and breaking his leg.\n\nAlso Told in:\n\nFlynn, Mike.

{"url": "https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-road-hog/", "title": "Pig in the Road", "author": "Barbara Mikkelson", "publish_date": "May 19, 1999", "claim": null, "rating": null, "article_text": "Claim: One motorist's attempt to alert another to an upcoming traffic hazard is taken as a personal insult.\n\nExample: [Cerf, 1970]\n\nThen he drove round the bend himself — and crashed head-on into the biggest pig he ever had seen.\n\nOrigins: The first print sighting of this tale is the one quoted above, from 1970. At that time the story was set in England, a\n\nland of twisty little back roads and extremely high hedges. Such a setting makes the scenario of one motorist's screaming out to another about an upcoming road hazard all the more plausible.\n\nBut as urban legends do, this one migrated to the United States. In 1984, it turned up in the Eugene Register-Guard in a form highly similar the version quoted in the example quoted (i.e., woman shouts the warning, man shouts back \"You're not so great looking yourself!\"). In 1988, listeners in Paul Harvey's radio audience were treated to a recounting of this tale, this time set in Oklahoma and told as a recent event. According to Harvey, an Oklahoma State Highway patrolman was driving his patrol car in the country near Waurika when he spotted a farmer jumping up and down by the roadside and shouting, \"Pig! Pig!\" The patrolman supposedly leaned out his patrol car's window to shout back \"Redneck! Redneck!\" Then, just beyond the next hill, he ran smack into a huge hog that had strayed onto the middle of the\n\nroad.\n\nI'm having a hard time picturing any Oklahoma farmer jumping up and down by the side of a road when he could be over the next rise rounding up the pig. As a story, it works better when it's two motorists coming together — one who has already had to swerve to avoid the porker, and another who doesn't know what's coming up. Putting a farmer into the tale causes it to lose whatever believability it ever had; even if the pig didn't belong to that particular fellow, rare is the farmer who would leave his neighbor's livestock to be run over instead of doing something about it.\n\nSometimes simple little urban legends work best as thinly-disguised advice, as this one does. \"Don't be so quick to assume the worst,\" says the tale. \"Not everything means what you think it does when it first lands on your ears.\"\n\nAn unusual take on the legend restructures it to have a different meaning, one stressing the importance of clarity of expression:\n\nA man driving along a curve in the road passes two monks. In passing the two monks cry out \"The end is near!\" The driver sneers and continues on down the road. After the driver screeches and screams, one monk turns to the other and says \"I knew we should have yelled 'Bridge out!'\"\n\nBarbara \"making the swine of the (un)cross\" Mikkelson\n\nLast updated: 7 April 2011\n\nBrunvand, Jan Harold.
